All results turn up the same and i have no idea if its the fault of the master test kit or if its due to ammonia being found in the tap water itself anyway.

t3_ru4v51,Whatever system we are living under perpetuates child abuse and neglect.,"Gonna be mostly a ranty post by a 16 year old cause I don't have much outlets, sorry if its incoherent. We are all aware of how asian parents are, whatever is normal discipline can be treated as child abuse in other countries. I'm sure I went through a lot of the same shit other people in a traditional Chinese family did, a non-exhaustive list includes:* Withholding pocket money* Withholding food* Forced to sleep outside the house* Forced to stand outside the house for hours* Forced to kneel for hours* Caned till bleeding* Slapped non stop for bad grades, not doing homework* Verbal abuse (idiot, stupid, r\*tarded, down syndrome)These is what I treated as normal for most of my life, and as I grew older, obviously I realised a lot of this shouldn't be tolerated, but what could I do. Weirdly enough, most of these stopped as I grew older into sec school and its just been verbal abuse. These has mostly shaped who I am today, and has led to a lot of mental health issues on my part, and growing suicidal ideation, which has been in my head for most of my life, but I only started acting on it when I was 13.It was when I was 14 that I started refusing to accept the verbal abuse, and would argue back, I think parents would call this the ""rebellious"" phase, my mom would call me a gangster. Police would be called, and they would say its disciplinary. Even after multiple suicide attempts and trips to IMH, nothing was done about my mother (father is not in the picture due to divorce).When I was 15, my older sister (2 years older) came out as transgender to my mother, obviously this did not go well, every few weeks there would be arguments, I learned to protect my sister since she was always the good kid who never got punished while I was the bad one so she would not talk back. It's not like we are trying to start shit with my mother, she would just find things to get irritated at, get irrationally angry, and we have to call the police to stop and get some sleep. So that's how it's been for the past year or two, which brings me to the past 2 days.My sister is working and wears women's clothing at work. Yesterday by chance, my mother bumped into my sister and saw her in women's clothing, when my mother got home before my sister, she took away all her women's clothing, and hid it somewhere we still don't know. Obviously my sister got really angry when she came home, but my mother would not talk to us and had us call the police, which is something that happens a lot. She will not listen to what we have to say, no matter how calm we say it, she views it as us being 'gangster' and really dislikes when people disagree with her.But the biggest reason she gets us to call the police is cause the police won't change shit. They just take our statements, calm us down, ask for ic, phone number, the usual questions, and just tell us not to provoke her. Yesterday, the same shit happened with police but we were told to lodge a police report at the nearest neighbourhood center.This morning thats what we did, and after 2 hours, waiting for the police to deal with a case that came up midway, and we were told to go home, ask for the clothes back, go to family counseling, and call the police again if she gets confrontational.Coming back home in the afternoon after lunch, we immediately asked for the clothes back, she told us not to talk to her like that (another thing she does a lot when she doesn't like what we are saying), and of course, to call the police. Knowing that family counseling won't do much since she has never listened to us once in her life, we called the police again.Same shit happened, took statements, ic, phone number. However, this time the police told us there's not much choice other than to go to court. **They want a 16 and 18 year old, to go to court, against their mother, over fucking clothing.** I told them how ridiculous this was, and they said ""It's not like theres nothing we can do, but..."", plot twist there was nothing they could do.And thats where this ends for now, I still can't believe this is our only option, something that will take probably months and many hurdles, just because my mother is a transphobic pos. She thinks she can do anything to us cause she brought us up with money and food (something she willingly took away to punish me). These parents need to realise that when they bring a life into this world, it is their responsibility to provide them with money, housing and food, not treat us like a fucking investment. All this traditional family and filial piety shit can happily disappear with our generation.Edit: Thanks for all the helpful comments, Ill look into the advice Ive been given, just wanted to clarify a few things. I forgot to mention in this post that we are looking to move my sister out and remove my mother as her legal guardian, the police told us to ask HDB, but I was wondering about any other peoples experience with it.And yea the police said going to court is our only option and maybe getting PPO but they also said getting PPO over clothes is a bit finickyIll definitely be in contact with social workers to advice us what to do from now on",Legal,-0.95,0.9,0.9,-0.9978,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ru4v51/whatever_system_we_are_living_under_perpetuates/,Reddit,2/1/2022 7:52

t3_s4kdva,For those that want tips on how to cope with depression or want to know what Singapore's mental healthcare system is like,"Hey all. 20M Singaporean here, have been coping with depression for the past 3 years. Here are some ways that helped me cope. I will just get straight to the tips, if you are interested in my back story or want to know the process of getting referred to IMH to read on.If you don't want to read this, here's the most important part. **You can only rely on yourself.**Tip 1: Don't rely on friends.Don't get me wrong, you can talk to your friends about your troubles and spend time with them to distract yourself. At the end of the day, you can only help yourself. They will not be there for you forever and friends come and go. They wouldn't want to keep someone who always talks about negative things around them.Tip 2: Listen to music.I'm sure we've all done this; lying down on your bed, staring at your ceiling and overthinking. Play some music. Just be sure not to play any music that's associated with bad memories. Finding new songs or genres of music really lifts your mood and gets your mind off the painful thoughts.Tip 3: Learn an instrument.I know this isn't for everyone but learning a new instrument can help pass time. Seeing your effort come to fruition is really satisfying and honestly makes you feel a lot better.Tip 4: Play with your pets.I'm sure there are some scientific studies that show that playing with your pets can help improve your mood. I didn't really look it up but personally it really helped.Tip 5: Take walks or just relax outdoors alone.Going out to the beach or somewhere quiet is really refreshing, especially after spending all that time cooped up in your room. You can bring your instrument along as well :).Tip 6: Talk to your parents.I know this may not be an option for everyone out there, but if you are lucky to have this as an option then please do so. Some parents may not understand what you are going through, but at least you're not bottling up everything. If you can't talk to your parents, try finding a psychologist (which is pretty hard here in Sg).Tip 7: Don't abuse alcohol or drugs.Having a drink now and then and crying really helps. But don't overdo it on the drinking, you'll only develop dependence, and same goes for the drugs (obviously).For those that are lucky enough to have not experienced depression, this is what it's like. Everyday waking up seems like a chore. You don't have motivation to do the simplest things like washing up or eating. You just want to lay in bed and close your eyes. You don't look forward to anything, not even your hobbies or playing games. You just don't have to will to do anything. You lose appetite, you want less human interaction and you just feel like fucking shit. I'm writing this to help those of you out there that feel the same way.Okay, now that I have laid out the groundwork for what I'm going to say, here is how I've learnt these tips. If you were just here for the tips you don't have to read on, but if you are interested on how the mental healthcare scene is in Singapore I will touch on that.I'm going to make this short, so I don't catch myself ruminating about my bad times. I was left out and bullied in secondary school leading to super low self-esteem. Was never invited to birthday parties or anything of the sort, not even hangouts at the nearby mall. I was lucky enough to be oblivious to how I was being treated by my ""friends"" though, so I don't think this played a huge part in my circumstance.Entered polytechnic, found my first actual group of friends and a girlfriend. We broke up shortly after getting together, later found out that she cheated on me with her ex. Being young and immature I started spiraling downwards into depression, drinking everyday, self harming etc. Lost interest in everything, basketball, studies, going out with friends, everything... Now that I look back it was really stupid of me. Almost jumped off a 25-storey building, later found out that my ex and her bf were making fun of me on social media for doing so. Fast forward about half a year later, found a new girlfriend and felt a lot better. My group of friends started falling apart because of small little arguments, only hung out with one or two friends. When I saw that the relationship was failing, started getting depressed and doing the same stupid things minus the suicide part. And to top it off, I fell out with my only friends in poly. Soon after, I broke up with my gf. I had no friends, no girlfriend. I decided to apply for deferment, which in my case was around 4 months or 1 semester. I went to see the doctor to get referred to IMH for depression. I'll touch on this part later, it's pretty important and i'm sure some of you are wondering what it would be like to be referred to IMH.During my deferment I thought it was a good idea to reconnect with my old secondary school friends. Everything was cool for the first month or so until they started to drift. I saw them as a distraction and it worked well while it lasted. Nobody really cared about how I just broke up or how I was feeling down 24/7. Soon after, I made some friends who were honestly of bad influence, started taking drugs and the sorts. After I cut everybody off, I went back to school, alone. As a retainee, nobody talked to me, I just went to school, sat through lessons and went home. It's pretty sad but I was fine with it.Here is where I tell you what I've learnt. Friends are a great distraction and nothing else. You can't rely on them, you can only rely on yourself. Sure, you can tell them about your problems, cry to them or spend time together. But at the end of the day, **you really have to reflect on yourself and stop moping around.** They have their own lives too, and they can't always be there when you need someone even though you were there for them when they did. Whenever any one of my friends was feeling down, I would drive over to their place and give them company. I did this countless times. But when I really needed somebody, no matter who I called, nobody would pick up. Nobody would care that I was feeling down. I don't blame them, I just wish that I cared about myself more. Now I wonder why I spent so much time and effort caring about others when really I should've been taking care of myself, though it would've been nice if they reciprocated. Don't get me wrong, you can cry and talk to your friends as much as your want, but don't expect anyone to be there for you when you really need someone, even for those who claim that they care. Friends come and go, that's just how it is.After realizing this I decided to cut contact with everyone, except those that were still worth talking to.Yes, it is lonely. Very lonely. Most of the time I would wake up with no notifications on my phone, no one talking to me, no one asking if I wanted dinner that night. I don't even have friends to play games with. But I've been caring for myself, making sure that I'm setting myself up for the future, when I actually enter adulthood.One more thing. Sure, you can smoke or drink, but do so in regulation. Trust me, if you drink yourself to sleep every night, your depression will still be there when you wake up.I abused K2 and weed because I had no one to spend time with. I had no friends, so I would go out alone and take drugs to relax and enjoy my alone time. Luckily for me, I didn't take anything more serious and it was just a phase. Once I stopped taking them and faced my problems straight up, I didn't want to go back to taking them. Although it does help you relax and get rid of your problems, it's only temporary. And it could lead to drug addiction. Nobody wants that.Okay here's the more interesting part. Singapore's mental healthcare. Here is what I did to get referred to IMH. I may not remember everything in detail. I went to a private clinic and told him I was showing symptoms of depression. He would write a letter and then you would go to a polyclinic to have a psychiatrist have a look at you. If they think that you should be admitted to IMH, then they would write another letter and you would have to take it there. This process takes around 3-4 months. If I remember correctly, you have to go for multiple assessments. Meaning that they would ask you the same questions as: ""How is your mood? How is your appetite? Have you lost interest in your hobbies?""The sad thing is that these psychiatrists aren't there to listen to your problems and give you advice. They are just there to assess you. Once you go through the multiple assessments, they will schedule an appointment for you at IMH. The waiting time is at least 1-2 months. During your first appointment, the doctor has access to the information that they collected from the assessments, and they will prescribe antidepressants. You have to return every 7 weeks (I think?) to refill your medication. And yes you have to pay, I was on 3 different types of medication at one point, each visit would cost me about $200. The sad thing is that throughout this entire process, unless you see a private psychologist costs $300+ per session, they will only refer you to one after your first appointment at IMH. And then you have to wait at least another month or two for your appointment. So throughout this entire 6 month-ish process, they only assess you and give you medicine. In other words, they just do their job. There is no therapy whatsoever. I didn't bother to go for the psychologist appointments because they just took so long.And here is another story to top it off. There was a period of time, quite recently in fact, where I was really down in the dumps and felt like I was going to do something stupid (off myself), so I drove to IMH A&amp;E to talk to a doctor or something. I understand that there are people out there with schizophrenia or more serious mental problems, but when I went there and told the front counter that I was afraid that I was going to do something dumb, I had to wait at least 3 hours before being able to see a doctor. You had to wait at the waiting area for 3 hours. I just took more drugs lol. Not even IMH A&amp;E can help you, unless you are willing to wait 3 hours or more, but if you're suicidal I don't think you would wait 3 hours.I've stopped taking the medication for about a week now. I do not have friends to rely on, I only have myself. I know hearing me saying you can only rely on yourself is sickening but trust me, take care of yourself. The only people that will take care of you are your parents or your maybe your significant other. Not even IMH cares.If you have any questions do leave them in the comments :).Edit:Thank you all for the comments and suggestions.

t3_s674vp,Why does conscription in Singapore last so long?,"Singapore is has one of the longest conscriptions in the world, even longer than countries actively threatened by its neighbours. For comparison:Israel: [30 months active service]( active service. Reservists can be called up but are virtually not in any year unless there is a crisis.Military Situation: Israel's political situation is always tense and violent. Neighbouring countries such as Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Iran do not recognise it as a legitimate state. Since its creation Israel in 1948 has fought eight major wars, many smaller uprisings and low-level insurgencies in the Middle East. Israel is routinely attacked by insurgents through bombings, artillery and guerilla fighters and deploys its military beyond its borders to fight these insurgents.South Korea: [Up to 21 months]( active service. Reservists may be called up for up to 4 years on the Mobilization Reserve and up to 8 on the Homeland Reserve.Military Situation: South Korea is in a de facto state of war with North Korea, a nuclear armed rogue state under an absolute dictaroship with a million man active army. It has fought one major war, the Korean war, where North Korea invaded it to try and seize control. Since then several rare skirmishes at the DMZ have occurred. North Korea routinely threatens to invade and even use nuclear missiles.Taiwan: [Officially abolished in 2018, but Taiwanese males still serve 4 months of conscription.]( Situation: Taiwan is considered a rogue province by mainland China. It has fought in the Chinese Civil War which ended in 1949 and three Strait crisis between it and China. China plans to one day reunify Taiwan and [has never ruled out using military force to do so.]( Chinese airplanes enter Taiwan's Air Defence Identification Zone daily. The CCP also heavily punishes any country recognising Taiwan in any way, including an famous visit by Lee Hsien Long to Taiwan which China raised a furor at.Singapore: 22-24 months, plus approximately six months call up reservist. Can be called up up till the age of 40 for non-officers and 50 for officers.Military Situation: Since independence Singapore has had one low-level conflict with Indonesia during Konfrontasi which ended in 1965 when Indonesian President Sukarno was deposed in a coup by the Indonesian military. Konfrontasi ended just one month after Singapore became independent. Singapore maintains friendly relations with all its neighbors including free trade, diplomatic visits and joint military exchanges. The tensest time in Singapore's history would be during the 1991 National Day Parade, when Malaysia and Indonesia conducted a paratrooper exercise with 300 paratroopers 20km from the border.Why is Singapore special? Our total service period is approximately 30 months which is as high as Israel and much higher than Taiwan/South Korea. Yet we are in much less danger. EDIT: A lot of good arguments from both sides, but what we all seem to agree on is that minimally NSFs should be paid more to recognise their contribution and to partially offset the lost income suffered, especially for NSFs from working class families who need it the most. If civil servant pay all pegged to private industry, so why not do the same for NSF? Use a basic $10/hr full time salary in private industry as a basis. Eight hours a day, five days a week for fifty two weeks a year. That's a 1.7k basic pay a month for NSF.",Legal,-0.8,0.95,0.9,-0.9959,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/s674vp/why_does_conscription_in_singapore_last_so_long/,Reddit,17/1/2022 15:52

From tray return ambassadors to the controversial all-but-mandated vaccination programme, the PAP takes on an increasing authoritarian stance that seems ill suited to today's circumstances.Lee has always favoured the saying that ""unpopular policies must be rammed through despite opposition from the masses, as he knows that it will benefit Singapore in the long run.""

t3_slecp9,How is rental discrimination still so rampant in Singapore?,"Hi guys, just wanted to get the perspective of locals on this issue. My friend from India moved from another ASEAN country into Singapore recently and couldn't even find a place to rent after a month because of his ethnicity. He's a graduate from a great uni, well spoken, immaculately dressed social guy whose lived in multiple countries and his expat package is probably higher than 90% of the locals. Now if this guy faces so much trouble in a routine part of moving to a new country, I can't imagine how hard it must be for most of my less well-to-do compatriots. I saw atleast a dozen screenshots he sent where the realtor agents keep telling him ""the landlord only wants chinese tenants"" or ""indians can't rent here"", etc. It was pretty insane this kind of stuff still happens in 2021.I just wanted to get the perspective of locals. Do you guys know about this? Does the government know this happens? I suppose the realtor agencies are at the mercy of the landlords and can't do anything if the landlord is prejudiced or racist. Surely, there must be laws against this because such overt racism with written proof in the west would be an invitation for legal action.I've been getting a bunch of job enquiries from Singapore and I've been declining them all on account of this (i even openly tell them that racism from the locals is my main concern). Am I overreacting and being paranoid in telling them no? Is my friend an extremely unlucky person or is this kind of xenophobia totally normal and accepted over there? I've heard this sort of thing happens a lot in Japan but didn't expect it in Singapore as it has a different, more tolerant ""image"". Is there anyway the government can intervene or educate people to be more open? Are there atleast conversations happening at a societal level that addresses these things or is everyone just all about their work and life bubble?

t3_smn0bb,Why do Singaporeans not insist on better bike infrastructure?,"I know... I know... many people in Singapore hate cyclists - because recreational cyclists use the roadways seen as built for productivity &amp; the pavements (when they exist) are not wide enough to share with people. Bear with me 1 sec. Commuting by cycle to work or errands is sustainable, equitable, fun &amp; healthy. Climate, gradient &amp; size of Singapore is perfectly suited for it as a means of daily transportation. If you haven't tried, you might be amazed how much easier it is than walking - the slightly faster speed with less effort spares you time in the sun, and cools you. Rain just cools you more! I have ridden to work in pouring rain, and it doesn't take long to dry &amp; clean up.Only problem: the infrastructure (even new stuff) is really awful. Regulations &amp; design make it extremely hazardous for a cyclist to try to turn right. The new law mandating 1.5m passing distance is undermined by the continued expectation that a cyclist stay far left. There are many kms of PCNs &amp; trails, but they are often disjointed, lack clear markings, include staircases, terminate at inaccessible flyovers (i.e. Pandan river North), and don't reach residential areas across the island to connect to places of work or shopping.Today I tried a new, longer route taking me from my far-flung West neighborhood to downtown and around Sports Hub. First photo shows a brand new staircase (installed just Nov 2021) which has a completely useless bike ramp (too close to the railing, which catches handlebars) - prior to installation this was an easy gradient dirt trail. Unfortunately now the new infrastructure connection is inaccessible to anyone on wheels (disabled or otherwise). There was plenty of distance to build a ramp, but they cut into the hillside and put stairs instead. Why?? Second photo shows an inaccurate Google Maps which made me think I could easily cross Merdeka Bridge to get to Sports Hub - I encountered multiple staircases to cross the bridge, barrier walls preventing me from getting to the PCN by the river, and eventually found the only real connection was to take an unmarked crossing across the high-speed entrance to Stadium Rd, where the median isn't even wide enough to safely pause with a cycle. No directional / informational signs anywhere.Serious question - I don't mean to bash Singapore. I certainly understand as the city has evolved, there would be some poorly planned older infrastructure. But why does the population accept such poorly designed NEW stuff? Cycling is historically not a rich man's hobby - it's a means of movement, health &amp; access for the masses. I just struggle to understand why people have tolerated this ongoing prioritization of cars in Singapore. Is there an advocacy group here that works with the government to increase equitable access to public spaces during infrastructure planning decisions?Thank youEDIT: Thank you everyone for the largely supportive and civil discussion! Really lifted my spirits and gives me hope for the future of Singapore because I had the wrong impression that no one else cared about this. Apologies that I couldn't keep up with all the comments as I had a lot of work to do. Regarding the weather.. Singapore simply is not THAT hot. Mean temp is &lt;28C and it doesn't fluctuate much. Compared to Dubai or South India, or summers in Europe or Americas or Australia, it's really not hot at all. Sunshine is not dangerous - it's actually really good for you! See [ Singapore has no typhoons (very rarely), hurricanes, tornadoes, snow, sleet or ice. There is a reason a person can bike 4x as far as they can walk: it's EASIER. So less effort, less sweat, plus more breeze to cool down. Just a fact. OK, it's hot, but it's not the hottest place in the world - it's totally within functional range (IMHO)",Transport,-0.9,0.95,0.9,0.9888,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/smn0bb/why_do_singaporeans_not_insist_on_better_bike/,Reddit,7/2/2022 10:25

There were no other instances where I could have gotten it as that was the only time I was unmasked while being in close proximity with a stranger.The very rule that was supposed to stop the spread was what spread it to me. If the smm didn't exist, there would have been more tables available and that stranger would have found a table elsewhere.

t3_sv422k,Concerns on housing valuation,"I have recently bought my first home and am currently in the process of getting the paperwork completed. As part of the process I have taken a loan from a bank. I was told that I would have to pay for having the valuation of the house done. My understanding is that this is for the bank to ensure that the loan they are extending to me can be recovered in the event of a default (ie is the house really worth as much as they are lending to me).When I enquired whether I would be able to view the valuation report, I was told that the valuation amount would be the same as the purchase price of the house.From anecdotal evidence, this practice did not use to be the case previously. As far as I can point out, it seems to have started during COVID times, during circuit breaker when it was not possible for a valuation to be done physically at the property so the shortcut method of valuation=purchase price was taken. I am quite surprised that this is still happening.Some questions I have after this experience:- Why do I have to pay for the valuation report if it is to be used by the bank. Should the bank not pay for it?- What value add is there if a valuation is going to mention that the value of the house is the same as the purchase price?- In case valuations are just a paper exercise, one loophole I can see is that banks will be able to extend credit purely on the basis of a hypothetical ""value"" determined by the agreed purchase price. There is no 3rd party stepping in to vett this, which is supported to be the job of a professional valuer. Does this not sound like a bubble in the making?Appreciate if someone knowledgeable in this topic would be able to share their views or correct me if my understanding is completely off-base here.",Housing,-0.7,0.85,0.8,0.9688,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/sv422k/concerns_on_housing_valuation/,Reddit,18/2/2022 0:33

t3_swzv8d,"Dr Goh Keng Swee's Warning to Singapore, 1972","#Hello there.Hey SG Redditors, had some time over the weekend to look at this thread on ""[What's a harsh truth that Singaporeans need to accept]( **I feel compelled to share [this particular speech]( by Dr. GKS that I've transcribed recently.**&amp;nbsp;#Further readings For further reading, you may refer to (i) [this missive]( by Hawyee Auyong (under guidance of Donald Low) as well as [this one]( by Academia.sg when you have the time. Both serve as an update and modern interpretation of this issue that has been plaguing us for the longest time. You may also be interested in [Alvin Chow's expose]( (of Dr Wealth) on The Real Singapore, as well as [Kyith's expose]( (of Providend) on the same subject.&amp;nbsp;#Singapore's Biggest Challenge ever since Independence (personal opinion)Just like how Malaysia redirects the attention of its population on domestic issues by emphasizing water disputes between SG &amp; MY from time to time, my personal opinion is that Singapore Inc. (to a certain degree) tries to do the same - there is little to gain from focusing on the few systemic issues that even our top leadership must feel frustrating to tackle effectively. These are the chief concerns that give rise to all other social ills (from homelessness, inequality, depressed wages, HDB prices) plaguing us today.&amp;nbsp;To me, a vast majority of the issues we face as a country boils down to **our greatest failure to cultivate ""indigenous entrepreneurship""** - (i) the arguable **inability to divest ourselves from the (effectively) complete reliance on Foreign Direct Investments**, and therefore (ii) the **creation of a resilient ecosystem whereby related industries support each other** (e.g. Taiwan and semiconductors) &amp;nbsp;And it's not as if our country isn't tackling it - I can see Singapore Inc. grappling with this issue for the longest time. If you read McKinsey's [The Great Acceleration]( Report, Singapore's policy making &amp; economic strategy makes a lot of sense - we try to focus on Semiconductors, Pharmaceuticals, Software, Technology Hardware, as well as Financial Services, all of which are industries well placed to take advantage of the next few decades, **but the implementation seems to always fall short of expectations.** &amp;nbsp;Going on Glassdoor to read the reviews, hear the rumors through the grapevine, read the archives on /r/singapore should give us a very good picture of the political and cultural factors at play. My personal biases aside, perhaps a civil discussion can be had?&amp;nbsp;#TL;DR Knowing how reddit operates (y'all don't click on links and read primary sources lol), **I'll be reproducing the speech in full within the comments below for convenience as well.** &amp;nbsp;**TL;DR Summary on GKS 1972 Speech, by my own interpretation:**1. Even with the experience and gravitas of being the Minister of Finance and Defence, GKS seems wary of going against party ideology in 1972.2. Singapore has always been highly dependent on **""foreign entrepreneurs""** than HK, TW and SK, and uniquely dependent on **""continuing supply of foreign workers to sustain growth""** *(is it any wonder as well given we are ~4 million Citizens &amp; PR v.s. combined population of ~2,700 million from South &amp; South East Asia. This is THE perennial and existential problem we have been grappling with since forever)*3. GKS was very concerned that we had to rely on both, citing difference in GNP / GDP (economic activity by Singaporeans vs Foreigners). **He advises to discourage industries that rely on low wages from sinking roots in SG, as well as establishing strategic ecosystems to nurture local entrepreneurs after they gain experience.**4. GKS predicted our current predicament - **heavy MNC reliance, each linked to global HQs not situated in SG, thus us depending on development and progress via research efforts &amp; higher value-add overseas**5. **Explains why foreign workers are of better quality / value than local workers by example of Malaysians**, which admittedly irks me. But hey, it was 1972.6. Insist we lessen our dependence on foreign MNCs, and specialize in certain sectors for a domestic base, **failing which we will have to contend with increasing income inequalities**. Feels familiar today?&amp;nbsp;#My Hope for the DiscussionIt is my hope that we can discuss this civilly instead of regressing back to the (i) gahmen / oppo / sinkie bashing, (ii) sinkie pwn sinkie, (iii) defeatist or (iv) ""you so smart you go do lah"" kinds of rhetoric that have only become too familiar while lurking for years in this subreddit.

t3_sxta3b,"Possible microinfluencer scammer asking people on instagram to buy crypto and send to her, promising great returns but with no proof that she's actually getting it.","**TLDR**: Probably fake microinfluencer (7.5k followers) is possibly scamming people by asking them to buy crypto and send to her account. Not sure if she is a mule or not, but I have strong confidence innocent people are getting scammed out of their money.The reason i am confident is that even though she is showing that she is getting money, there is no proof on the blockchain that she has sent any money out. Only received.She has a friend who supposedly first doubled her money. Then turned 450 in 4500. Then deposited 1k. Then deposited 2k to get 20k within 24 hours. However, there is **NO PROOF** of this on the blockchain. The only proof she has is a screenshot which i'm certain is badly cropped and fake.I'll probably get blocked by her soon but till then, I'll post updates. She has already privated her account and I'm thinking she'll delete it soon. I was planning to string her on a while more to get more info about her accounts etc, but the number of people falling for this is saddening so I hope this message goes out to them.Please help spread the news and keep your friends alert. I haven't been scammed yet (since I didn't send any bitcoin), so I can't lodge a police report. However, if you have friends who have, please DO REPORT IT! Do we have any recourse against possible scammers?Worst comes to worst, please report the account ( [ and possible accomplice ( [ ).Stay Safe.&amp;#x200B;**Long Version with Pics and Proof:**So I came across this ""influencer""\* (not very active but has significant and impressionable following) who may be scamming people. Her following includes some other influencers. I say ""may"" because her tactics are like all the scammers but I haven't given any money to lose yet, so maybe she's saying the truth. You judge and say.[Instagram profile of av.drey]( I'm not convinced she's a real person. The last post was 2020 and only thing she has posted recently is this possible scam. Then again, gen z be like that.She posted stories saying guaranteed bitcoin and showing ""proof"" that she's withdrawing 1000+ everyday with no effort. Most people would sense something is wrong and leave but i wanted to see whether it was a scam. [Screesnshot of her stories \(inclduing \_xminnx\_ Testimonial\) \*Had to combine 2 to fit reddit's limit.]( also had a ""testimonial"" from someone. I dont know who this person is but looks legit. A bit sus though as will see later.This Testimonial friend - Minyi - is going to be important later. Anyway, moving on...[i messaged her and she asked me to download the bitcoin .com app and register \(I have the screenshot but due to reddit's limit couldnt post the text where she asks me to register\).]( Asked me to click \\""Buy\\"" on BTC. ]( The default buy amount was 300 usd. She said to continue. ]( when you buy crypto, the amount is sent to a wallet with a unique address. Once you send to a wrong address, you have lost your crypto forever. That's how many scammers work - they ask you to send to them and promise to return more, but then they dont. [She asked that instead of topping up my own wallet, I top up someone else's one. ]( this makes it less suspicious because this is a financial crime due to the bank sending the money to the wallet rather than having it be sent through another crypto account. And people wouldn't be dumb enough to do that, right?&amp;#x200B;[ Anyway, when she noticed i was buying 30 dollars only, she asked me to do more. ]( scam tactic, because if it was not a scam, why not let me experiment with a bit first and then send more?[ Anyway, her justifications were vague so it didn't assure me at all. But i can see it may have assured other less suspicious people \(authority bias?\) ]( I explained that i cannot pay now due to bills. ]( of this is actually true. I have dependents whom i have to pay medical bills for. However, i do have more than 30 dollars in my account. [ She still encourages me to put that remaining money in even if it means cannot pay for kid's medicine. ]( this is a foolproof method or she is quite heartless. But hey 10x return in a day! who wouldnt want! Sadly, she ignored my request to lend me money even though she's swimming in it supposedly. &amp;#x200B;[ So i said I'll get back to her later. ]( confirmed the wallet address was the same one the other \\""testimonial\\"" girl from before used. She said it was.]( it appears that she forgot our whole convo and asked if i downloaded the app.]( I'm kinda scared when i saw her ask me the app thing again. Because it either means its 1 person scamming so many people cannot keep track. Or multiple people scamming using 1 account. Both suck.She gave me her wallet address. One of the great things about btc or crypto is that you can actually see the transactions in and out of a wallet. You can use a website like blockchain .com. Link to her account: [ i entered her wallet address and as if 3:20 today, there were only 39 transactions. Put simply, it's not an active trading wallet. ]( Update: as of 5 pm, there were 44 transactions, which means 5 more people went through the process i described and gave money to the wallet. ]( as of posting this, 3 more people were possibly conned.As you can see, the net amount in the wallet is positive, meaning it has received more than it has given out. So do you remember, this lady who supposedly got 4.5 k and then deposited a further 1k? Which wallet is she dealing with? No record of 4.5k going out! I think that means she is an accomplice!Anyway, the last time this wallet sent money out was last week. But our micro influencer says she's getting everyday? Which wallet is sending to her? I'm 99% convinced it's a scam. And more people are falling for it every hour.&amp;#x200B;[She posted this again just a while back.]( someone you know may have been potentially scammed by either party ( [ or [ ), please ask them to report to the police immediately unless of course they can show the transactions on the blockchain.&amp;#x200B;**Update:** Right as I was about to post this, one of the lines I'd cast caught something.Basically, I had messaged the ""testimonial"" friend (Minyi) about whether this was legit. The purpose was to see if they're part of the possible scam together or not.These were her responses that I got just now:[Supposedly she not only got 4.5 k yesterday, she also got 20k few days back. Why she would not put a higher amount if she already got 20k is a mystery.]( proof is not a transaction code, but a screenshot. And it is not even a full screenshot, just a cropped one]( confirmed if the blockchain address was the same. She said it was. I checked if there were any 2k deposits recently to see if her story checked out.Best I found was Someone deposited 1.1k yesterday, which doesn't support Testimonal friend Minyi's accounts. I suspect they're defrauding people together.(Verify for yourself: TXN Hash: [ )&amp;#x200B;[But I'll give her credit for one thing - as a scammer, I'd have thought she'd encourage me more to invest once I said \\""I think about it\\"".]( that's why I'm 99% sure this is a scam. Or maybe they're just bad scammers.So anyway back to the main person av.drey.I'm quite certain she'll disable her account soon so that everyone forgets about it. She's already privated it. [This is the person's face that is being used.

t3_t4nw45,"Fellow Dog Owners/Walkers , Please Be Responsible","I've been walking my dog for a while now, all the way from the park connectors, to the general pavements, to the beach. What I don't understand is how ignorant and stupid some dog owners can be. In fact I am so triggered that I have considered getting a vest to strap a GoPro to my dog. Don't blame others when you yourself can't control your dog.1. **Leash your dog**, idgaf how small or how ""gentle"" you think your dog is. You know damn well you don't speak dog and you don't know how your dog is going to react to other dogs. Small dog owners too, yes your dog might not be able to do much damage to other dogs, but for sure you don't want to be trying your luck with a 20kg+ dog.2. **Only allow your dog to approach other dogs or people if they give a verbal ""yes"".** You may think you know your dog well, but you def don't know how another dog is going to react to yours. Not everyone is okay with dogs, even if you think your dog is the ""gentlest angel in the world and wouldn't hurt a fly"" *rolls eyes.* Always hold your dog back unless someone asks to pet it. ELSE ASSUME THAT NO ONE LIKES DOGS AND WILL BE HOSTILE TOWARDS IT.3. **Please use a proper collar** if you can't control your bigger dogs, i.e. prong or choke chain. Yes, they are controversial but I much rather you give your dog that 1 second jolt of shock rather than it being forcefully put down later on for biting another dog or worst, a human. Your harness is only holding the dog back and I jolly well know most of y'all with your 25kg dogs can't hold on to the leash properly or even know how to stop your dog if it decides to lunge. You're walking your dog, your dog isn't supposed to be walking you.4. **Hold your leash properly.** This means not leaving a 2 meter slack line for your dog to approach others by itself or run ahead. You're not fishing, hold the line taut, with enough room for perhaps half a meter slack. You don't always need to grip the leash tight, but always be ready to do so. One hand looped thru the leash and your dominant hand holding the leash closer to your dog (for big dog owners). This makes sure you have 2 hands and the full force of two arms to hold your dog back if it decides to do funny stuff. Especially important if you're walking at a park connector or somewhere similar and there are a lot of people around you, which brings me to my next point.5. **Be ATTENTIVE.** Too many times have i seen owners with one hand on the leash and the other on the phone texting. You're supposed to look around to make sure that you can see what your dog is seeing and steer it away from potential conflicts. IMPORTANT - please watch out for our muslim friends. Some of them are super strict religiously and don't want a dog sniffing at their clothes, please respect this. Pull your dog aside and allow our muslim brothers and sisters to walk away first. In fact, this shouldn't just apply to them, but also to everyone in general. You don't know who is okay with a dog and who isn't. If the path is packed, just sit the dog down and wait for the people to pass, don't attempt to go through the crowd with the dog. Always give others the right of way when you are walking a dog.I don't believe in bad dogs, I only believe in bad owners. In fact, I hope that one day Singapore enforces those who want dogs to take classes before they're allowed to own one. Your dog is not your ""kid"". Its a freaking animal that believes in pack hierarchy. Love for your pet is normal but it is NOT a human being no matter how much you think it is. Its always the fault of the dog if it chooses to snap back at someone or another dog. You never win, don't bother.

t3_t8dtj9,Tracetogether revisited,"Wanted to give some thoughts after reading this article: [ some of the points in this article:\- "" Measures for contact tracing, TraceTogether and SafeEntry, will continue until Singapore authorities "" - 1) Is contact tracing still done and possible?. At the number of cases today its is highly unlikely that contact tracing is possible or even relevant. 2) many people do not report their ART positive status officially undermining contact tracing to be even possible; lets say for discussion sake that only half the people reports their Covid status, that means we have about 40k cases per day. Let say that each of them had contact with 20 people during their contagious phase. This would imply 800k people per day would be subject to ""contract tracing"" or about 14% of the population per day!; and 3) As per the same government rules one just need to sit it out at home when testing positive and can come out after 7 days in any case. **The rules literally imply no contact tracing to be required,** unless you wish to get you result registered, which is likely driven by the asymmetric advantages that you get for travel or to avoid a future booster.: ""If you are ART positive: Recover from home. No need to see a GP/polyclinic, if well/have mild symptoms. To register your results with MOH, visit a test centre ""\- ""We need to wait until we no longer need vaccine-differentiated measures"" - 1) what about MRTs, buses, they are not vaccine-differentiated, people just hop on and off. And keeping 1 meter distance in MRTs of buses is impossible. - so lets agree that the country is not really in a in a complete vaccine-differentiated state; 2) how many people are really non-vaccinated, there are around 2-4% of 60+ people non vaccinated. (source: [ Shall we let an entire country get organised around these few that had 1.5+ year to get vaccinated and at this point are either completely complacent and irrelevant in a democratic thinking or might have underlying complications that refrain them from vaccination which would be a status quo in any other scenarios anyways. 3) kids under 12y are not getting sick. Only 0.013% of cases under 12y has ever been to ICU. (source: [ )\-"" enable authorities to issue health risk warnings and notices quickly "" - 1) why would health risk warnings still be a thing if people are not required to declared their covid positive status? So health warnings are just done in case somebody decides to declare their status for the above mentioned reasons? So just rather randomThe comparison of tracetogether with seat belts is a statistical joke. Lets compare the mortality rate of today's Covid with the mortality changes one get in a car accident. If we make cars illegal, there wont be any car accidents either.I also see more and more places getting these automated Tracetogether gates, which mean money is spent and we are doubling down on access restriction. rant out",Public Health,-0.95,0.98,0.9,-0.9112,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/t8dtj9/tracetogether_revisited/,Reddit,7/3/2022 1:32

They will pay more taxes to support a higher dependency ratio. And as the entitled boomer generation moves into the elderly cadre, expect more elderly entitlement behaviours. Where they expect handouts because theyre retired but still sitting on a multimillion property portfolio. Where they expect younger people to defer to them, give up seats, cut the queue.

t3_tk12s0,Energy 2050 Committee Report,"[ I would like to encourage everyone to read the report proper. It has spawned a couple of Straits Times articles that we are discussing here on Reddit. It tries to come across as some sensible suggestions for the Singapore government to take but if you all go and read the scenarios it comes up with in order to support its strategies...well, here is an excerpt. &gt; In the late 2020s, studies confirmed that geothermal energy in Singapore was a serious contender as an important energy source. Geological studies showed that there was significant geothermal resource potential on both Singapores mainland and its offshore islands. While the lack of heat resources at the surface rendered conventional hydrothermal systems infeasible, next-generation geothermal technologies, which allowed heat to be tapped at depth, renewed hopes of deploying geothermal energy in Singapore. The first advanced geothermal pilot plant commenced operations in 2030, even as Singapore continued to monitor developments given the high costs to extract energy from deep underground and the concerns associated with seismic risks. In the early 2030s, advanced drilling techniques significantly improved the techno-economic viability of geothermal systems, due to the transfer of expertise from the oil and gas sector. As demand for low- carbon alternatives picked up, oil and gas companies had already pivoted to areas where their exploration and extraction capabilities would be relevant. Following the success of the first pilot plant, Singapore expanded into commercial-scale geothermal power generation in the late 2030s as costs decreased further. Geothermal energy became another major local renewable resource beyond solar for Singapore, and five geothermal plants were in operation by 2050 The entire scenario section is some dream like bullshit. Like, if I took LSD kind of trip far far away from reality. But don't take my word for it. You all really need to read it. There isn't a single peer reviewed paper backing up any of the claims made in any section. In every scenario, there is a massive chunk of hydrogen or electricity imports. WHY!? That is literally the worst for our energy security. It has some good ideas, truly. But broken clock and all that. EMA should just be honest about its intentions. It is simply trying to push hydrogen as the future and disguising its ploy in a buffet of sustainable energy solutions. The most egregious is its ridiculous conclusion that Singapore can be net zero emissions by 2050.",Others,-0.8,0.9,0.85,0.9918,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/tk12s0/energy_2050_committee_report/,Reddit,22/3/2022 11:45

t3_tnn8yk,Strange scam involving leaked data (?),"My legal name has the format [Surname] [Chinese name], [Western name]. This will be important. Yesterday afternoon I received a call from a +65 number. Knowing that it's a scam, I picked it up anyway to be greeted by a human speaking Mandarin, claiming to be from MOH, who addressed me using the format [Surname] [Chinese name]. This was especially interesting considering a few factors: government officials typically speak English and would address me by [Western name] [Surname], no one addresses me by my Chinese name because they **will** get it wrong the first try, and the scammer used my dialect surname instead of using the Mandarin reading of my surname. For this reason I use my Chinese name as a shibboleth because it is so difficult even actual Chinese native speakers might get it wrong the first try, meaning that friends no matter where they are from will always try to use my Western name. Even online my name formats are either [Western name] [Surname] or [Surname] [Chinese name] (,) [Western name]. So I went on the offensive by pointedly asking it ""What is my full name then?"" in Mandarin, but it kept dodging the question. After a lot of persuasion I managed to get my name spelt out *but without the Western name*. I kept telling it that the name is still incomplete and kept putting on the pressure to spell out my full name, because [Surname] [Chinese name] alone is not my full name. The scammer kept dodging the question until it lost patience and asked me if I wanted to hear it say my IC number, which made it even more intriguing. After accepting the challenge, the scammer said an IC number that actually got everything correct *except for one number*. And it's a number that would indicate which year I was born in. Now here's the question: assuming the IC number is actually scraped correctly but recited wrongly (the wrong number would have been invalid due to the wrong checksum anyway), how did they get only my Chinese name, yet not get my surname in Mandarin correct (meaning they did not get my name in hanzi). There's so much wrong with this scammer and I have to know where the data leak was coming from.",Public Safety,-0.9,0.95,0.9,-0.979,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/tnn8yk/strange_scam_involving_leaked_data/,Reddit,25/3/2022 14:33

t3_uaxgff,Thoughts on this kind of anti-scam mailer?,"&amp;#x200B; the rise in scam cases these days, I am all for an anti-scam awareness initiative. However, I think there is a difference between sending a generic mailer with ""do not ignore this letter"" ([ and sending a letter with one's personal name and address. As mentioned in the article, the former uses behavioural insights principles such as large red fonts to capture the attention of the receiver. I would even applaud the initiative if the envelope were to look more 'scam-ish' (e.g. too-good-to-be-true job offers, overly-attractive deals, unrealistic investment opportunities, put the envelope inside a mystery box, etc.). Now, what about using a personal name and address on a formal looking envelope? Of course it would prompt anyone to open it, not because of temptation, greed or gullibility but because we would genuinely think that this is something legitimate. At the end of the day, this mailer loses the essence of what a scam is.As this was mailed to my old address, I even made time after work just to go and open this letter. At best, this incident is an *experiential* marketing strategy of making me feel scammed, that is, scammed of my time...Disclaimer: I am just an ordinary citizen voicing my personal opinion about an anti-scam initiative.

t3_udq8f2,Responsible disposal of bulky Items in SG,"I know many ppl just throw their furnitures and whatever by the ground floor lift/stairs, and I admit I used to do that too. So I called town council for the bulky disposal service, got a number and it was interesting afterwards that the item I wanted to throw is outside of the scope. Well East Coast TC clearly didn't mention it on their website but other town council like tampines GRC do state it. For eg, gym fitness equipment is one of unqualified items and I am throwing elliptical trainer.But I am so confused. If washing machine and fridge are in the scope then... Why aren't other big electric stuff included? Massage chair, TV for example, also aren't included. Even kitchen cabinets is not a clear yes/no. So how am I supposed to throw them then? I supposed I could call a disposal vendor and pay for it. But if we threw by the lift? The town council also has to move them anyway? Which actually was what a relative said to me previously, that's why they felt it was justified to throw there. Like cause they at least brought it down?I just don't feel it's very right, like it blocks the path and when rain comes it's not ideal. E waste disposal vendors only want small items too. They don't even want a big full tower desktop (and you bring it down) but a laptop is fine. So how do you guys throw your big electronic appliances? PS: The waste disposal vendor from TC did collect and help me to dispose, but I weren't sure if he was happy with it. (I did disemble into seperate parts) He for sure weren't smiling, and I dunno whether I should have tipped him because he did me a favor? Or did he do me a favor?

t3_uf5qid,Migrant workers are humans too. Please talk to them and support them,"Edit: I hope my post doesnt come off as condescending or virtue signalling - it is genuinely meant to increase awareness of the plight of migrant workers and small things we can do to make it better for them. Apologies if you felt that way, but that is definitely not my intention!I am not sure if my post is going to gain much traction or if people here are going to be sympathetic. But this is my story.I started volunteering adhoc at ItsRainingRaincoats earlier this year, and came across so many migrant workers living in not-so-great conditions and going through a lot of mental anguish that you and I dont have to face on a daily basis. Almost all of them pay hefty contract fees to agents in their home countries to come and work here, making peanuts every month. They need to pay back the agent fees while supporting their families. They get no subsidies on transport, food and daily expenses - a lot of them pay the same price as you and me for daily items like eggs, rice, etc. They get only one day of leave per month and frankly, the work they do is unsafe and backbreaking. Having not seen their family and other loved ones for 2+ years, theyre not in the best state of mind right now. The least we can do, as Singapore residents, is to talk to them as fellow humans. Im not saying that you need to go out of your way to get them food, snacks or do favours for them - but just talk to them as a friend would. Find out more about their day. Ask them how they are. Treat them as an equal - all of us are in this country to make a better life for ourselves, whether we were born here or chose to live here. Today, I interacted with a migrant worker whos painting our condo walls. It was just general chitchat, where I asked him about his work and family situation and how he breaks his fast everyday. He told me that I was the first one to interact with him (mind you, theyve been working here for close to 1.5 months). I felt immensely guilty and ashamed - that Id not done spoken to him sooner, and that other people havent spoken to him either. They paint the walls daily in harsh sunlight, getting no break in between.We all have our own biases - but this is my plea to go break them and look beyond them. E.g. a lot of people on this sub believe that they need to work harder so that BTO flats are ready on time, but thats really not their fault and its silly to blame them in my opinion.Thanks if you read till here!",Employment,-0.8,0.85,0.8,0.9833,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/uf5qid/migrant_workers_are_humans_too_please_talk_to/,Reddit,30/4/2022 6:57
t3_uf73e4,Skateboarding in malls?,"On mobile, sorry for the formatting. At the risk of sounding like a grouchy old boomer, I thought I'd see if anyone shares the same opinions as me on this. Recently encountered 2 teen boys who had just been skating in the underground area near the Esplanade. As they were leaving the premises they took the opportunity to do some tricks on their boards near the escalator (coming up into the Citylink mall/exchange area near Garrets Popcorn. )When they were stopped by the elderly security guard they continued to do tricks on their skateboards down the stairs and up the escalator. When the security guard called for back up, 1 of them taunted the guard ""wah I'm so scared"" and proceeded to skateboard into the crowd causing a number of people having to swerve out of the way to avoid him. The other was a bit more subdued but did nothing to dissuade his friend. The 1 on the skateboard got off his board soon enough but not without taunting the 2 elderly security guards again with some faces and walking off. I'm not entirely sure what the point of his demonstration on the board was. He skates pretty decently but was it really necessary to do it on the stairs of an indoor mall? When the nearest fully equipped skate park is about 1 train station away? The security guard stopping them is not to keep the skaters safe but to keep the other people around them safe. I know there isn't much they can do. But why taunt them? What's the point? This isn't the only incident of skateboarders ive seen in malls and it seems to be a growing trend to try to do outdoor activities in places where it isn't exactly safe. (IE, rollerblading in malls, etc) I feel like something more should be done to stop them from doing these in the malls...

t3_us4wdq,"Singapore weather and ""wet bulb"" temperatures","Pakistan and India are in the news in the last few weeks because of extreme temperatures (45-50C). The combination of temperature and humidity creates what is called the ""wet bulb"" temperature. The combination of both high temp and humidity for just a few hours can be harmful and even at worst, deadly for unprotected humans, even healthy adults. [Here is one of many articles]( explaining this issue.So... what about Singapore. We do not have these 45C+ temperatures but we do have right now is both high temperatures (35C+) combined with very high humidity. The website [wbgt.sg]( draws from government data to calculate the wet bulb temperatures across Singapore. Right now (midday 18 May) they are [black at all stations]( and some are at or above the 35C wet bulb level which is considered [hazardous]( to human health. Serious discussion: So... should we be hearing more about this? If these readings and calculations are accurate, why are articles in the ST talking about these conditions with key quotes about this being ""not a heatwave""? Why does [weather.gov.sg]( not have a hazard warning category for extreme heat? Is it shown somewhere else and I have missed it? And possibly related: There have been a spate of recent fatalities on worksites, [PM Lee acknowledged this week]( 10 in the last month. Well [here is an ST story]( from 2 months ago citing heat stress as a proven contributing causal factor in workplace injuries. I hope someone out there is joining the dots and connecting honestly with the general public and outdoor workers about the risks. We are in a La Nina year which tend to be cooler than average. When we rebound to an El Nino which might be even hotter we better be ready.Thank you for listening to my sweaty TED talk.",Environment,-0.9,0.95,0.9,-0.7323,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/us4wdq/singapore_weather_and_wet_bulb_temperatures/,Reddit,18/5/2022 4:39

t3_utko3h,Just another foreigner struggling to find a job in Singapore,"EDIT: Most of you guys were very helpful but there are one or two people who are...pissed? Claiming that I took advantage of Singapore. I don't know if their fierce ""love"" for their country is a common thing but geez, calm down. I truly valued my time here and worked really hard in my course. If you're just hopping on to say ""boo hoo, it's your fault"", move on. I am not asking for sympathy. I literally asked for advice, and received it, thankfully. I already explained myself in the comments below.&amp;#x200B;So I recently graduated from Singapore Polytechnic with a diploma in Media &amp; Communication and I'm a Burmese national. When I was on Student Pass, I worked a few jobs with ease, part-time then full-time until the expiration of my pass. Now I have applied to more jobs and went to interviews that went really well until I see the interviewer's face drop when I told them I need a Work Pass. Instant no.The obstacle is...well, very inescapable and I'm constantly disappointed at the fact I may have gotten a job if it wasn't for my foreigner status. Not gonna cry about it, obviously, there will be a local preference and I don't do anything that's high in demand. And often the companies I apply to have no foreigner quota.I come here to ask for advice. What do I do? I cannot go home to Myanmar. I don't have the option. There is no possible way to advance a career there at the current state, let alone find a job. I had the option of going to university in the UK until I decided over 20,000 pounds a year was way too much for a path I wasn't even terribly excited about. My goal is to literally just support myself in Singapore, to pay for rent, food, survive, yanno?Is there anyone on the same boat? Would appreciate any advice. I keep on applying to jobs, aiming for bigger companies but there isn't a lot I qualify for although I think I have a decent portfolio and amount of experience.

t3_uvagui,Watch out for scams,"Hello lads. With the rising amount of scams, I have a story for yall today, so gather round and hear the tale. So a few days ago someone on telegram messaged me about a job offer. Being as dumb as I am I responded, curious to what antics that these people are up to. After she asked me a few questions I said that I didn't want a job (after all, who would want a $400 a week job where you just rate products???). For a brief moment, all was well.Then suddenly today a man messaged me telling me about how the tele person said I was interested in a job??? Sure as hell I was pissed so I told him I didn't want anything. He then persisted and said to take a look first. So I did. Aureus analytics was the company. A quick Google search yielded perfectly clean records of the company. Cautiously, I proceeded to (stupidly) sign up (but with a burner username, password hehe).Then came the suspicion: website doesn't match the official website, poorly cropped logo, VERY consistent wait times between submitting ""reviews"" (which were just click and submit, no reviewing whatsoever), and a shitty ding after submitting.So I pulled out my computer and started looking around the website. Apart from the review screen, other ""help"" and ""faq"" screens all looked like it was made by a teenager. A quick recording of the network activity yielded absolutely zero actual data being sent over. This website was sham as fuck. My broke ass actually almost got scammed by this fucker.A quick screenshot and a little bit of questioning with no answer caused the entire website to go offline. Luckily, he sent me a groupchat link where the other unlucky victims were held hostage. This allowed me to message every single person to change their passwords and stop contacting the scammers.By now the scammer was silent, occasionally coming online to read my messages. For a moment, I thought all hope was lost. Then, I remembered a few snippets of chinese in the source code. Sure enough, after a few messages in chinese, he replied.Currently I'm trying to obtain more information on this man and his little gang of scammers to report it. I know it's really stupid for me to reply to these types of messages and most probably won't do it again in the future, but the satisfaction of taking down an entire site is pretty good. The site will probably be up again soon and I'll be sure to check it occasionally incase they try to pull off scams again. Just want to let yall know that they are getting smarter everyday and especially when they start recruiting younger people to help, things will really get out of hand with the sophistication that will entail. I really think that something needs to be done by the SG government in order to address the recent surge. Every other day I get scam calls and I can tell this issue is getting much worse by the day. The problem is not easy to solve but I guess maybe yall can give some suggestions that may be useful for the government agent reading this post .Just want to let everyone know to be very careful of modern day scams. Half the victims I messaged were middle aged so be sure to not fall for one yourself.

t3_uy7xcy,HDBs and Prime Location Housing (PLH),"**5 years construction, 10 years MOP** By the time you are ready to change house, Your kid go secondary school liao. If you want to have more than one kid and need a bigger space the only thing you can do is sell with the MOP? I say the super long MOP isnt good for scaling families or even planning for kids. &amp;#x200B;**Cannot buy private during the MOP** Yup 15 years you cannot buy private home. Be prepared to be locked in. Less options for you but it was not really about the options I suppose.&amp;#x200B;**Reselling eligibility** Selling is gonna be tough because of the small market. You can only sell to a **married couple,** one must be a citizen. Oh and that couple must earn less than the cap (14k combine income now, this will change) Its a small market. While it is good to limit buyers.... this also means more difficulty selling. Keeps price affordable but the demand for the flat is going to be lower than you expect from a prime housing area.&amp;#x200B;**6% clawback** I can't comprehend why this was done on gross and not net (haha, someone share please). Only affects the first owners for getting it at subsidized rates which is ok. So there is a chance (however small and unlikely) to lose on this. Imagine being in a tough spot and selling at a lower rate. But honestly considering this is in prime area, these HDBs make sense to be pricier following market value so that those that can afford can buy it.&amp;#x200B;**Cannot rent out the whole house even after MOP and for eventual buyers after the MOP** I like this one actually, *if only it was applied to all HDBs in the prime area*. But no it only applies to new blocks. So it's just absolutely ridiculous. Resale HDBs in the same estate that are not PHL will likely see price increase. Why? Because restrictions wise those units offer more flexibility. This one is completely counter intuitive to me but hey if it takes 99 years to PHL the entire estate they will do it. **Honestly not a fan of the whole PHL thing.** With the new restrictions and rules on top of the existing rules (racial quotas) the complex mess that is buying a house and sorting out finances is worse. As a sinkie, purchasing a home without thinking about its eventual resale value or your next move is **a royal dumbass move** \- Inflation, increased taxes and all you ain't helping anyone if you don't consider your finances. 15 years BTO to MOP finish is long.And again I can't stress how this is beneficial to existing resale home owners in the similar location (y'all lucked out, seriously!), because they have less restrictions.To fight the flippers, the ones who need to buy the property to start off are now in a worse off situation. I can think of more ways to fix the problem like - building more houses.l would just fight the flippers directly. sap them on the net based on how long they stayed and how many properties they own. Think I am missing something here, feel free to chime in.&amp;#x200B;**Anti-merit system?** As someone who has worked for 5 years building a stronger income hopeful that my salary will be more competitive and BTO in a better estate, now the system pull stunt. I guess now we lock in for the long haul and don't have the freedom of options until MOP is done OR I can go fight resale market (which honestly I cannot seeing the prices soar these past 2 years) OR I can go and try to swim in the private housing market.

t3_v8ui3q,There is certainly more than meets the eye about the Reema Razif vs SPF saga,"I will lay out some facts we know for sure from her posts, SPF's press release and also news articles. But it is in my opinion that her shenanigans act as a **huge setback** to general societal views about working childbearing mothers. It's a fact that the civil service is already extremely supportive of pregnancies, as compared to the private sector, which she does not seem to realise.**Facts:*** Reema has had 4 pregnancies in the past 5 years (from her facebook post)* Reema alleged discriminatory practices due to her performance grade dropping from a B to C in 2019, which is 3 years after her first pregnancy (from her facebook post and [ST article]( Reema made complaints about not getting a farewell card (or dinners, mementos or tokens) on her last day, and was quick to say that it's not about not getting gifts, but it's the "" realisation that youre dispensable. "" (from her facebook post)* Reema was given light duty assignments for the entirety of her pregnancies, and she has acknowledged that "" she would be taken off patrol duties and assigned office roles, such as manning the armoury counter. "" (From SPF press release and ST article)* Reema also finds that her effort and hard work went ""unnoticed"" although she was working on the frontlines during covid-19 (ST article)* Reema made a post in April 2020 saying that she was still "" hustling with no complaints "", and was still "" trying to prevent/minimise crime, protecting the innocent, rendering assistance &amp; advise, being exposed to unpredictable dangers, facing a widespread of personalities . ""* She joined SPF in 2011 as a corporal and was promoted once in 2015 to sergeant (ST article)* She also questioned (herself) why "" many juniors were promoted so quickly. "" (ST article)* (Added through an edit) The SPF confirms that ""The SPF does not penalise officers who are pregnant"" and this is corroborated through the fact that Reema's performance grade was not affected in the first TWO years of her pregnancies between 2017 and 2018 (she only complained about a drop in grade in 2019)**What is unclear*** Whether her supervisor said in verbatim ' cos you were pregnant what' in response to why her performance grade dropped* Whether or not she was made (or suggested) to do work during her maternity leave (She claims she was advised to take up some projects during your maternity leave while SPF maintains that she "" was not asked to work while she was on paid maternity leave. ""**The discrepancies*** Reema holds the view that the effort she has put in should warrant a B grade instead of a C grade and claims discriminatory practices due to that drop in grade. * How could she have claimed in her April 2020 post that she was still going around rendering assistance and advice while being exposed to unpredictable dangers when she has acknowledged that she was taken off patrol duties while she was pregnant? Does she have an inflated or inaccurate view on her perceived effort vs her actual effort?* Her performance grade was not at all affected in the first two years of her pregnancies (2017 &amp; 2018), she only complained about her grade dropping from B to C (which is the default average grade in civil service) in 2019. * It could very well be that her back to back pregnancies took a toll on her physical health that she was not able to keep up with the demands of a police officer. If anything, her superior had to justify the drop in grade on paper.* Reema thinks that she did so much work and put in so much effort (no doubt it could be true that she tried her best), but her colleagues were not appreciative of it and she felt dispensable. * For **5 years**, her colleagues had to take up her share of patrols and extra desk work while she was on maternity leave for 1/3 of each year. How could she not have picked up on the fact that maybe her colleagues were getting burnt out because of the additional workload caused by her back to back pregnancies? * The fact that her colleagues did not bid her farewell tells us a lot about her relationship with her colleagues (and superiors), which brings me to the next point.* It took her ~~5~~ *4 years (2011 -2015)* to get promoted from a corporal to a sergeant (a commenter suggested that this could be due to the change to a unified rank scheme, where the minimum entry rank is sergeant, which suggests that this promotion was not based on her performance) while she claims to wonder why her juniors were getting promoted quicker than her. * There are several possibilities: * There is a mismatch between her perception of her performance and actual performance * Her educational qualifications hampered her promotions * The relationship with her colleagues and superiors was not optimal",Employment,-0.8,0.9,0.8,0.5816,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/v8ui3q/there_is_certainly_more_than_meets_the_eye_about/,Reddit,9/6/2022 23:57

t3_viu35t,So I wrote this to my MP the other day...,"Hi XXX (name withheld)&amp;#x200B;We spoke last evening about our thoughts on the repeal of 377A. You said that if you had to vote on this issue you would vote not to repeal 377A based on the moral guidance of your Christian faith. I was dismayed, and as I mulled over your justifications later that evening, and even today, my feeling shifted from dismay to perturbed. Yes, I am perturbed if that is your reason. Let me explain why.&amp;#x200B;1. The Christian faith as in all religions, preaches many things. Some are universally good, some are simply untenable in todays world - I mean, the Bible does say a lot about rights to own slaves, divorce and (the lack of) womens rights. So are you consistent enough to rely on your faith when it comes to every issue put on a vote, or do you conveniently single out certain beliefs from your faith to suit your own bias and perceptions?&amp;#x200B;2. It is precisely your faith that opposes and oppresses the LGBTQ community at large. One just need to observe comments and motivations made within the faith community to understand the constant onslaught of discrimination and threats against the LGBTQ family. So by relying on your moral conscience to your faith to make a decision that continues to oppress and make unequal a gay persons standing in his society, have you abandoned your moral conscience of many others (amongst which are your constituents as well) to strive for a more equal society? As I reiterated last night, we are not taking away rights from the heteronormative society, there is nothing they lose by us gaining a bit of dignity in our lives.&amp;#x200B;3. I stand by what I said last night that an MP elected by his constituents should be representing the voice of his constituency instead of being guided by his personal beliefs. Otherwise, why bother even having Meet The People sessions? The whole point of the MPS is for the MP to listen, understand the ground and grievances of the constituents, and represent their voices in parliament. I completely understand that one issue can have many voices and opposing opinions. Then I feel as an MP, his vote should always be - always be - to be on the side of the disenfranchised. I have presented to you enough reasons why the LGBTQ community is constantly at a disadvantage and losing end of so many other laws and regulations that support a heteronormative family that typing them all down here just overwhelms me negatively even further. How much real and tangible disadvantages will the conservatives incur on the other hand, from a repeal of a law that although isnt enforced legally, is being wielded by them because it is still there to justify their continual discrimination? None. But they do get less intangible weight when imposing their belief system on others.&amp;#x200B;Lastly, my example of the analogy of a wealthy MP voting against the appeal from his poorer constituents to raise taxes for the rich because he is reluctant to lose his wealth is very real and relevant. You said But who would do that? Yet this is happening around the world, even in Singapore. I believe an opposition party wrote this - We will continue to argue against the proposed GST increase in parliament, as well as for alternative forms of revenue generation, such as wealth taxes&amp;#x200B;Have a think about what I have put down here. Again, I sincerely appeal to you to listen to the LGBTQ voices on the ground to have a better understanding of the real struggles they face in their daily lives, and the lament of the potential they could have achieved if they were given a little more equality.",Legal,-0.9,0.95,0.9,0.9777,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/viu35t/so_i_wrote_this_to_my_mp_the_other_day/,Reddit,23/6/2022 10:49

t3_w1ycym,Fact Checking the Shitty Slides from the HC talk,"Edit: Added headings because reading this hurt my eyes.Edit (2): Adding some helpful additions from other posters. I haven't had the time to personally fact check all of the other additions, so I am just attributing the poster and including their sources.In part due to boredom, but also in hopes of showing our LGBT members that they probably do not have intestinal worms, I decided to fact check all the claims made in the HC talk. Special thanks to u/shimmynywimminy for providing better resolutions of the slides. I also copy (with thanks) some other posters acknowledged below.# Summary\- The slides are largely inaccurate. Either because the sources cited are not reliable, are very old, are not academic sources, or an unholy mixture of all of the above.\- There are however some points which are not wholly inaccurate. That said even here, other relevant factors tend to be ignored. E.g. saying LGBT are more prone to alcohol abuse, without saying that they are more driven to substance abuse due to the discrimination they face. I mean after looking at the slides in detail, I think I can say that the HC counsellor's talk really made *me* want to have some alcohol. \- Some issue are however reflective of areas of concern for the LGBT. Of course this doesn't meant that being LGBT is bad because they have these issues - in the same way that because certain ethnic groups have specific issues they deal with.# 1) 58% of Homosexuals have intestinal wormsThe given source is ""*Fields, Dr. E. ""Is Homosexual Activity Normal*"" *Marietta, GA*. Google brings up this document - [ which looks a lot more like a propaganda pamphlet rather than an academic study. The claim that homosexuals have intestinal worms is just asserted without any evidence on the study done to obtain such numbers (""*Depending on the city some 39% to 59% have been infected with intestinal parasites such as worms*"".As an added bonus ""Fields, Dr. E."" is not a medical doctor. He is a chiropractor. He is also a white supremacist - [ did however find academic [research from 1980]( showing that homosexual men have an infection rate of 67.5% compared to 16% for straight men. Given how old this research is, I don't think you can rely too much on this. Some posters have also pointed out that the research method of this paper is flawed due to sampling bias.However even this paper says ""A*mong the homosexual men recent foreign travel, living in a homosexual household and promiscuity were not correlated with intestinal parasitic infection, but* ***cleansing of the anus before and sex was associated with a significantly lower prevalence of infection***"".In other words having intestinal worms has nothing much to do with being gay or sleeping around. Rather it has everything to do with washing your bum. PSA - wash you bum.# 2) 1 in 15 Homosexuals is a pedophileThis comes from ""Psychological reports 1986 58 pp. 327-37"" ([ What the relevant part of the abstract actually says is this - ""*Considering only children's claims of sex with men, about a third were homosexual molestations*"".I will admit that I didn't read the full paper and only saw the abstract, but the problems are immediate - this is a study about victims of child molestation. How do you derive demographic trends on all homosexuals being pedophiles? The study is also old (1986). Just to highlight some great comments from u/TaliyahTt \- [you can molest a child of your same gender without being homosexual]( 3) 33% of homosexuals struggle with alcoholismThe source comes from ""*Kaifetz. J. ""Homosexual Rights are a Concern for Some*"" *Post-Tribune, 18 December 1992.* Well the first and most obvious point is that ""Post-Tribune"" sounds very much like a newspaper rather than an academic publication. Unfortunately I cannot find a copy of the article online. This guy does seem to be citied very frequently by anti-LGBT articles so it's a bit surprising that the actual article is so hard to come by.Unfortunately, I do want to point out that there is a generally observed trend that LGBT communities may abuse alcohol more than straight communities (see e.g. [ Of course one of the major reasons is that LGBT people are pushed to alcohol as a way of coping with all the anti-LGBT stuff they have to put up with. So please reach out to any LGBT persons you might know that are dealing with these issues.# 4) On average a gay man has up to 80 sexual partners a yearThe source for this is ""Sexual transmission of Hepatitis A in homosexual men : incidence and mechanism"" ([ This was a study on Hep A transmission and not sexual partner habits among homosexual men. While the full text is not available, the abstract says "" We performed monthly examinations and serologic tests for antibody to hepatitis virus A (anti-HA) in a study of 57 heterosexual men and 102 homosexual men followed prospectively for a mean of 8.9 months and 6.1 months, respectively... Diaries concerning sexual behavior kept by homosexual men showed that the acquisition of hepatitis A virus infection contact."".I'm going to guess that somewhere in this study, the 102 homosexual men indicate in their dairies that they had sex with 80 sexual partners in that year, and that figure is being used in the HC slides. Of course would be a bogus conclusion since these findings are incidental to the main research being conducted (Hep A transmission).The study is also really old - 1980. A more recent study ([ that is directly on point suggests that gay men are more likely to have around 3-4 in a year (depending on age) and 15-67 in a life time (also depending on age). So, not 1000 in a life time, but 67.# 5) Perfect Correlation between Childhood Rape and Homosexual Behavior. 47% of gays admit to having been raped by an adult man during their childhoodMaybe because I'm not a counsellor, but just on the wording of this I have absolutely no idea what is being said. If there is a ""perfect"" correlation then we should expected either (a) all childhood rape victims are homosexual; or (b) all homosexuals were raped as children. Both seem absolutely unlikely.Anyway the source is [ The study asked respondents whether they have been molested as children. The results are - straight men and women (24.4% and 24.6%) versus gay men and lesbian women (49% and 52%, or specifically molestation by same gender 45% and 29%). What's interesting is that the study *directly states that* ""**Most men who molest boys and most men who molest girls are heterosexual in their adult sexual preference** (Groth and Birnbaum, 1978) "" and "" **It must also be borne in mind that the present homosexual participants may not be representative of homosexual persons.** ""So the best I can say about this is (a) LGBT people being molested as children is a terrible thing; (b) however this does not mean that LGBT are more likely to molest children; (c) in fact if you are molested as a child and the molester is a man, then that man is likely to be straight; and (d) this study is not reflective of LGBT people generally.# 6) Homosexuals are 2% of population but 33% of Pedophile RapistsThe source is [ The 33% figure apparently comes from the *Jounal of Sex &amp; Married Therapy* (""1/3 of male sex offenders directed their sexual activity against males"") and ""*Journal of Sex Research* (""homosexual pedophiles commit about 1/3 of total sex offences against children\*).\* Unfortunately there are zero detailed citations to these sources.In general this statistic seems to not account for the fact that heterosexual men can commit sex offences against boys (see 2) above.I'm sure it will shock no one that the writer of the source is neither a doctor or an academic. He's a conservative radio host from the American Family Association which (**surprise!**) has been designated as a hate group. [ This guy also thinks that the holocaust was caused by homosexuals in Nazi Germany.# 7) 78% of Homosexuals have STDsAt this point I'm starting to wonder why I tried to unravel all these lies and getting a headache. So I hope you don't mind I duck out and just cite u/nutting_ham who dealt with this in his post:&gt;Thanks to [u/shimmynywimminy]( I found the actual source. **It's worse.** It's a [book written by Enrique Rueda]( published in **1982/1986**, who doesn't appear to be an academic. That's right folks it's **not even a study**, it's in fact actually a **680** pages book from a raging homophobe, which according to [this amazon review]( had a lot of things to say. For the sake of brevity, the writer suggests that, homosexuals are sinful, that his CATHOLIC CHURCH would be under fire for him speaking the truth. The cherry on the frothing cake -- he suggests that the gay agenda is out to establish a female controlled homosexual society where MALES would be fuckin' LIQUIDATED by abortion and the few remaining males would be used as spermatozoa sources for future implantation. (No really **I swear I'm not making this shit up.** Also funny how it sounds like the Great Replacement Theory doesn't it?!) &gt; &gt;Anyway because it's not a study, **I was not able to access the testing methodology** behind this 78% statistic from a catholic guy who has some talent for writing some crazy dystopian shit, and clearly, not an academic in any way.# 8) 23% of children with lesbian parents have been sexually abusedThe source is [ This a lifesitenews article citing a study by Mark Regnerus who is described as a sociology professor at the university of Texas. I'm not a sociology professor, so I'll just note that this study has attracted so much controversy that it has an entire wikipedia page detailing why other academics have criticized the findings of Regnerus - [ what it's worth here's what wiki also adds - *Major academic organizations including the* [*American Sociological Association*]( [*American Academy of Pediatrics*]( *and* [*American Medical Association*]( *dispute the validity of Regnerus's data and conclusions reached thereof, arguing that unlike previous studies, the statistically tiny number of same sex couples in a study whose sample group largely consisted of failed heterosexual marriages where one of the parents was allegedly homosexual, make it impossible to extrapolate any information about same sex parenting*. [ this one my personal take is that I don't have the time or energy to dive into such a contested academic area, so if any dear reader wants to take up this issue, please go ahead.u/oOoRaoOo adds""&gt;I'll bite on the NFSS (new family structures study) by Mark Regnerus. &gt; &gt;i think i went off-topic haha. In short the answer is maybe at best w/regards to the sexual abuse statement. Kids in lesbian families comes from all sorts of situation and may/may not be abused by their lesbian parents/partners due to the way they are grouped together. Which i believe the statement is insinuating. &gt; &gt;NFSS due to poor response rate from same-sex families, he grouped up data when he should not have, and compared with nicely diced groups from the heterosexual side, basically made the two groups incomparable. &gt; &gt;[Definition of same-sex family]( = if your mom and/or dad had EVER had a same-sex relationship from when you were born to till your 18 or moved out, you are in the same-sex group (lesbian mothers \[LM\] or gay fathers \[GF\]). Doesn't matter if that relationship is long distanced (hence no contact with child), doesn't matter if it lasted for a second. If yes is the answer, congratulations, you are in! &gt; &gt;Response of same-sex group is so low (same sex marriage was illegal then, so duh?) that they just lumped everything (intact families, adoptive, etc) together. Note: only 23% of LM and 2% GF children lived with their respective same sex partners for 3 years or more. Ie. 23% of 163 (38) for LM and 2% of 73 (2) for GF. Even worst, there are only [2 LMs]( that can even be considered equivalent to a intact biological family. &gt; &gt;On the other hand, we have nicely carved out heterosexual families into intact biological families, adoptive, step, single groups etc. &gt; &gt;Turns out, the result of the same-sex group is inferior to intact biological families (birth parents). Gee, I wonder why. &gt; &gt;Lets not take into account that the LM and GFs do not have official recognition in the 90s, which these kids would be living in. They are, at best, roommates and only 1 adult in this same sex relationship (if there are even 2 parents!) has legal ties to the child. &gt; &gt;Oh i also didn't mention that this study was funded by the [conservative think tank]( and [is sped up]( for the purpose of having this study having an [impact in various court cases regarding same sex marriage]( which [it is NOT intended to be as stated by the AUTHOR.]( &gt; &gt;[Other source]( (not used as I did not read thoroughly, though it is more recent) &gt; &gt;P.S. Please do not judge the [BTB]( source by its cover (the last post is a trollish post), they are pretty good with their reports, which you will see on the right. I recommend this [report]( or the [cnn video version]( which reports on one of the subjects (?) in the study that helped pushed conversion therapy in the States. [Spoiler about the researcher]( 9) Homosexuals represent 2% of pop but 67% of AIDS PatientsThe source is [ \- the data appears to be from the CDC, which reported that ""*however in 2013, MSM accounted for 67% of all new HIV diagnoses*"". The primary source from the CDC does appear to check out, and also maps current trends recorded by the [CDC]( as well as in [Singapore]( nothing much to say there other than maybe the slide is inaccurate to lump all LGBT under ""homosexuals"" when this is clearly a gay man issue.Still **wear your condoms, and practice safe sex.**u/fioccinauci adds:&gt;For 9), I additionally would like to point out that AIDS is not a moral failing (its a medical condition!) and I reckon that why society at large stigmatises it is, cyclically, largely due to its association with gay men (cf. how it was reported in the HIV epidemic of the 80s in the US). &gt; &gt;Also want to point out that there are many data points for HIV/AIDS that one could cherrypick including that, globally, [women have been found to be disproportionally affected by HIV both due to biological and sociological factors]( Its quite maddening that whoever did this series of facts about the LGBT community cherrypicked the data specifically in a way that further demonises the community.

t3_w206jz,"Oi, You Xiao Ah?","*Stigmatism of mental health in past &amp; modern-day Singapore*Growing up, I always thought people who had ""mental problems"", like the neurotic psychopaths you see on TV or in the news, mostly supervillains (e.g the Joker) or that one flasher in your neighborhood, are like what the general population thinks, ""violent, unstable and unreliable"" It was a totally black-and-white view of mental health, but it was the norm.In school, ""autistic"" was an insult and depression was something to be made fun of. It was seen as an edgy or attention-seeking thing to claim. However, when I was in Secondary 3, I started to feel symptoms of depression and anxiety. My social and academic performance deteriorated but I didn't speak up, because I thought I would be deemed ""weak"" and ""abnormal"", as my parents fed into the societal stigma themselves. Luckily, I managed to gather my courage to tell an adult about it this year and I quickly got a diagnosis of General Anxiety Disorder, depression and ADHD, the former having sprung over not being diagnosed with ADHD earlier. I am in therapy now and am relatively happier. I started reasearching about mental health too, and found it was more common than I thought. Apparently, according to a 2018 health survey by IMH, approximately 14% of Singaporeans have experienced some form of mental health condition in their lifetime. Despite this, most of them do not seek any form of help for their mental health conditions and those who tend to do so after a significant delay after the occurrence of their condition (yours truly). Why, you may ask? **MENTAL HEALTH STIGMA** Mental health stigma causes disorders like mine to be seen as negative, socially discrediting behaviour, so much so that it becomes an undesirable and rejected stereotyped rather than an accepted and normal one, moreover, it is the root cause behind poor support and care towards their disorders. In Singapore's context, it can be largely attributed towards our traditional beliefs and cultures, where pride is prioritised and anomalies such as mental health is seen as a sign of shame and weakness (cannot ""save face"" in front of your peers). Our cultures are traditional patriarchal, which is why men are discouraged from showing physical and mental weakness, due to the toxic masculinity stereotypes. The question of the purpose reducing the stigma of mental health could be answered by its dire implications. In a 2018 study conducted by IMH, 78.4% of individuals with mental health conditions never seek any form of professional treatment. Those that do delay it on an average of 11 years for OCD, 2 years for anxiety, and a year for depression which is more than enough time for it to consume you. To make things worse, Singapore has **extremely poor mental health support**. It has one of the lowest rates of psychiatrists among first-world nations, with approximately 2.8 psychatrists for every 100,000 residents, compared to Australia, which has 13.5 psychiatrists per 100,000 residents. This general lack of financial and societal awareness on both the government and people will lead to lasting negative impacts on the general public perception of mental health, which only makes the battle against its stigma more difficult. Now you may say: but with the advent of the Internet, the younger generation is more open-minded. Well, that is not totally right. Although there is more campaigns on mental health awareness now, a 2017 study on mental health stigma in SG youths found approximately 44.5% of teens associated mental illnesses with derogatory terms like ""stupid, dangerous, crazy and weird"" while 46.2% said they would be ""very embarrassed"" if they were diagnosed with a mental illness. In contrast, only 25.5% of them associated mental illnesses with empathetic terms like ""pitiful"", ""sad"", ""needs love/care"". Overall, I personally feel unless there is greater awareness on mental health, as well as a proactive push against its trivialisation rather than some campaigns and charities for good PR but thrown aside the minute it's not popular, it's impacts on our society and health can be more serious in the future. One proposal I have is for the government to subsidize mental health care, as personally the psychiatry and therapy costs are too expensive for those who are underprivileged to afford. On a positive note, schools do focus on a lot of mental health awareness projects for us students.",Healthcare,-0.9,0.95,0.9,-0.9936,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/w206jz/oi_you_xiao_ah/,Reddit,18/7/2022 14:04

t3_w58dzb,International shipping options?,"I live in sg and frequently need to make shipments overseas, typically to the US.In the past year or so I've always been using SingPost because I couldn't find a better company, but I quickly ran into some issues1) singpost Tracking does not update beyond ""arrival at destination country"" for many countries, including Australia and USA. My recipients have no way to know when to expect their mail because there are no movement updates (which facilities it's at, blah blah) or an ""out for delivery"" update. Worst of all, it doesn't even reflect delivery even if a successful delivery has been made. That makes me especially susceptible to false claims of the buyer not receiving my goods (which I would have no way of proving) and potentially could lose me money.2) For some reason, all other shipping companies are BLOODY expensive. I've been asking around for recommendations of international shipping companies and so far people've all been saying DHL. but (unless I'm looking the wrong places) DHL only seems to offer their DHL Express service for outgoing shipments from Singapore. It's fast, but ridiculously expensive. Like, 100 bucks for a 500g shipment to Malaysia.I know I'm probably missing something (???) because I've had a friend ship me a 2kg parcel from GERMANY and all it costed was 20. It's a different service and took a few weeks but I'm content with being able to find a service that can do that. Does DHL not offer that kind of shipping service for outgoing shipments from Sg?Same situation with FedEx, UPS etc. I can only apparently find their express options, not the normal options.have yall ever shipped overseas with dhl/fedex/ups? would like to know. i seriously suspect I'm missing something.",Infrastructure,-0.7,0.8,0.6,-0.9607,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/w58dzb/international_shipping_options/,Reddit,22/7/2022 11:36

t3_w6lzfh,These are the concerns from the Protect 377A group,"in case you were wondering what slippery slope of worst-case scenarios theyre adamantly trying to protect Singapore from, I found this on their website and linked to from Jason Wong's FB posts. It references the Universal Periodic Review reports that I and other LGBTQ advocates worked on last year:Section 377A is the first line of defence against a slew of LGBTQ+ affirming policy changes that would affect virtually every sphere of our lives. The knock-on effects of the repeal of S377A, if it happens, are real. LGBTQ activists will push way beyond the repeal. Ideas have consequences. Bad ideas have victims. The repeal of S377A will cause more men, women and children to become the victims of LGBTQ ideology.Below is a non-exhaustive list of activists demands collated from their 2021 Joint Submissions to the United Nations Human Rights Office Of The High Commissioner (OHCHR) [see Joint Submissions 2, 3, 4 and 6].- Implement Comprehensive Sexuality Education Programmes (normalises LGBT in schools)- Extend State healthcare subsidies and financial assistance for transgender healthcare (aka transitioning), and coverage for LGBT persons in same-sex partnerships- Recognise or allow same-sex marriage in Singapore- Sensitivity training for mental healthcare and social service professionals to provide affirming-only support- Allow LGBT persons to use Assisted Reproductive Technology (e.g. IVF using sperm donors, surrogacy etc.)- Recognise same-sex partnerships in housing policies and guidelines- Amend the Administration of Muslim Law Act (AMLA) inheritance laws as it does not entitle people in same-sex partnerships to inherit assets- Allow change of legal sex simply by a legal declaration of intent to transition (includes pre-sex change surgery to change legal sex)- Provide option to remove ones gender marker in NRIC/passport- Ban all forms of conversion therapy (removes the options for therapy that is not blindly affirming of LGBT+, e.g. no prayers or counselling that discourage pursuing LGBT+ life choices)Source:  if they dont act now, LGBT people may one day be able to get married, apply for BTOs and start a family, children will be taught that LGBT people exist, trans people may opt to change or remove gender markers from their NRICs so as to avoid the harassment and violence from being constantly outed, and low-income same-sex couples may be able to apply for financial aid.can you imagine the destruction that will causehow will society survive",Legal,-0.8,0.9,0.8,-0.8678,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/w6lzfh/these_are_the_concerns_from_the_protect_377a_group/,Reddit,24/7/2022 3:29

He kept replying with the same answer that he ""just wanted my photo"" and kept insisting that I send the photo to him on WhatsApp. Obviously I was weirded out and refused to comply. When the train reached the next station, I just quickly made up an excuse that I had to alight at that station and bolted out of the train door.

t3_wpsw8g,Harrassed on MRT Part 2,"Today I was going to work as usual. During the transit, I was scrolling Reddit and came across this post, that a man was asking the OP to take a photo and whatsapp him. Immediately my first thought is that OP might be a girl and I was thinking 'walau, why Singapore become like this liao?'6.30 PM I was going back home as usual. The same train that the aforementioned OP took, from Downtown to BP. I walked and took the escalator going up. In the midst of it, a slim and small guy (I am 173) wearing specs with black shirt and pants, in his 25-28 I believe, talked to me. As I was wearing earpiece, I coudln't understand what he was talking. Lazy me didnt turn off the music, I just keep 'huh' 'huh'. Turned out he was asking me to take selfie and whatsapp to him. I think he asked like 'Can you take a photo and whatsapp to me?' Suddenly my brain got an electric shock, shag, it was the Reddit post that I read this morning! But seriously dude, I am a guy also WTF. Then I straight away said no of course. That black shirt spec guy was very angry and show me his middle finger while walking up the escalator. Also at the same time, he kept on swearing. Everyone around was looking at him, but siao lang doesn't care one ma. I followed him from a distance, he rushed to take the bus that just arrived. The BP bus stop on the right-hand side once you come up the escalator, with Hillion on the left.I didnt feel angry, just feel sibeh strange.

t3_wqhava,"Web site with review of rental properties, agents, and landlords","Hello.Singapores rental property market is red hot at the moment, especially with expats coming down from Hong Kong and China. Every other day I hear stories about tenants getting treated unfairly by their landlord - doubling of rent, bond withheld, bending the definition of fair wear and tear etc. The same can be said for property inspections where agents are behaving quite poorly towards prospective tenants - eg asking tenants to submit a bid before allowing them to see the actual property.Therefore I am planning to launch a web site / online community where tenants and prospective tenants can submit detailed reviews of properties, landlords, and agents in one place. Before I go any further I would like to test how much demand there is for such a service and what use cases you would like to see. Secondly, I have developed the basic product, but I am concerned about potential lawsuits for defamation. For instance, tenant might submit reviews which (rightfully) put a landlord in a negative light if he / she / they treated the tenant poorly. I heard defamation laws are quite strict in Singapore - if a landlord sees such a review, could he / she / they sue me as the platform owner, even though I didnt write / submit the review? If anyone has any knowledge about dos and donts for such a service in Singapore, it would be much appreciated.Thanks in advanceAn expat",Housing,-0.6,0.8,0.6,-0.6187,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/wqhava/web_site_with_review_of_rental_properties_agents/,Reddit,17/8/2022 6:11

t3_wttyuc,Strange man coming to my HDB apartment,"So since the start of last month, my neighbors and my family noticed a stench of urine from the drain at our corridor. Once there was a big plop of shit just lying at the side of the corridor. Lately, we noticed a strange man wearing a black mask, dark blue hoodie, loitering at our doors. When we open the door, he would run away and dart into the stairwell. This usually occurs at night, sometimes even close to midnight. It's scaring us, given that my neighbors have children.I understand that HDBs are public housing and do not have security guards, so the corridors are counted as public areas. Even so, releasing feces and urinating at the corridor is just ludicrous. Not only does it have a foul stench, it attracts pests and cause great trouble to everyone living on the level.

The space kinda resemble a wind channel because the two blocks fully surrounds it and only way for air to leave this channel, is through the top end of this channel aka. the top floors of the blocks.Someone/some neighbours who resides in the two blocks I am in, are chronic smokers, and he/she/they smoke at their service yard, which has windows opening to the air channel mentioned above. What happens whenever they smoke, is that the smoke that gets puffed out, is trapped in the air channel. When my yard windows are opened, the ""stagnant"" smoke gets into my house, into my family laundry (left to dry at the yard) and the kitchen (beside the service yard). My family are non-smokers thus keep our yard windows closed pretty much at all times.Just curious if anyone has been in similar situations and managed to get a successful resolution eventually (or silently suck thumb)?Like to end with that I respect that smokers have their rights to puff, especially in their own homes.

We actually topped Asia with data from a global health study but apparently a 2020 local study highlighted that we may be underestimating the estimates themselves...Worst thing was that the study mentioned that only ""1.6% of those who screened positive for an ED reported currently being in treatment"". As far as I know, only SGH has a dedicated treatment facility (KKH has doctors dealing with ED but not a dedicated team like SGH I think) and IMH isn't well-equipped either. We keep saying that we should care more about mental health and stuff but I don't really see much being done per se to support facilities, infrastructure, outreach etc. More importantly, the stigma is still very much prevalent here...

t3_y3pa63,Chan Chun Sing's MOE is critically out of touch with the ground sentiment - as corroborated by a survey done by the Singapore Counselling Centre,"**Official position of Chan Chun Sing's Ministry of Education**The Ministry of Education (MOE) has long [parroted]( its stance that the well-being of their teaching staff is of paramount importance to them and *""provide a range of resources to support their well-being""*. Chan Chun Sing (CCS) has also [stated]( that MOE values its teachers and pays close attention to their well-being and work-life balance and has taken steps to help teachers manage their workload.With that being said, MOE has also acted to increase the workload of teachers by [implementing]( the likes of *""Wellness Ambassadors""*, addressing mental health and workload issues via a chatbot (and counselling hotlines) and [sending]( teachers on industry attachments to give them a break.CCS has also made [statements]( like *""A hard cap on teachers' working hours is unrealistic""* when asked if they would consider a hard cap on teachers working hours and vague, non-committal [claims]( like *""streamline processes to make best use of resources""* and *""build shared responsibility with parents and community""* in response to a question on whether MOE has plans to reduce admin, non-teaching workload for teachers.Mrs Chua-Lim Yen Ching, Deputy Director-General of Education on the topic of stress from performance appraisals acknowledged that there are gaps in the system, but goes on to [say]( *""So that at the end of the day, I may give you a grade, you may not be happy, but you can accept it,""*. She also [chimes]( *""There are always coping strategies to help you, and you just need to practice some of these.* on the topic of burnout.She also [gripes]( that *""not everyone has to be a wellness ambassador* when asked if the additional responsibilities as a wellness ambassador will increase the teachers workload.MOE actively [encourages]( teachers to [share]( their mental health concerns with their school leaders or even cluster superintendents.MOE, from its internal surveys, seem to hold a view that teachers in general can cope with work stress and are not gravely affected by mental health issues, as seen from their [survey]( that 7 in 10 teachers said they can cope with work stress or the [statistics]( that ""fewer than one in 20 teachers who had resigned in the past five years had pointed to stress or workload as reasons for leaving their jobs"".&amp;#x200B;**The sombre reality as reported by 'The Teachers' Series' - a report by Singapore Counselling Centre (Source:** [**SCC**]( of infographic from SCC's report]( top 3 emotions reported by teachers were the feelings of being 1) Overwhelmed, 2) Frustrated and 3) Worried. This differs from MOE's sentiments that teachers are able to cope with their workload.A quarter of teachers reported working more than 60 hours a week - that is 12 hour, 5 day workweeks OR 8.5 hour, 7 day workweeks. But Chan Chun Sing thinks that a hard cap on working hours is unrealistic as teachers will still go beyond the call of duty to attend to their students' needs. But how much of that 60 hour workweek is spent on additional administrative tasks remains to be seen.Teachers shared that the top 2 issues they faced are 1) Lack of work life balance and 2) Excessive workload. Teachers reported finding it hard to establish and maintain boundaries between their professional and personal lives. They also mentioned about excessive workloads brought about by current teacher-student ratios and administrative duties like CCA or event planning.Chan Chun Sing when asked about excessive workload mentions vaguely about streamlining processes and giving autonomy to schools without elaborating on how these could help with the marking load or event planning issues brought up by teachers. The previous education minister also [insinuated that our teachers are not experienced enough to make smaller class sizes work]( and cites studies that say smaller class sizes do not relate to better achievement, but ignores all the others that show a positive correlation.With increasing numbers of special education needs (SEN) students in mainstream schools, teachers are stretched even thinner with regards to classroom management and ensuring that all students keep up with the curriculum.A sizeable portion also perceived systemic challenges such as a perceived lack of empathy from management due to the management's lack of understanding of their stress. But yet, MOE expects teachers to raise their concerns about burnout or mental health issues with their school leaders whom are also directly involved in appraising them, determining their bonuses and career progression. It's no wonder that fewer than 1 in 20 teachers who resigned pointed to stress or workload as reasons for leaving, or that only 10.8% of teachers turn to their supervisors as a source of support for workplace stress.No amount of mental health counselling, process streamlining or school autonomy to roll out new initiatives at their own pace will help improve our teachers' lives unless the bulk of additional administrative work (CCA/event planning or late-evening meetings) is addressed. Pushing the responsibility to [parents]( or school [alumni]( also does absolutely nothing to address these systemic issues.It's also laughable that MOE uses statistics from internal surveys, exit interviews and teachers' [responses]( to the minister as an accurate way to paint the situation on the ground. As though teachers would want to look incompetent, burn bridges or dare tell the minister that his ideals are anchored in la-la-land.If it was true that 7 in 10 teachers can cope with their workload or that fewer than 1 in 20 teachers had pointed to stress or workload as reasons for leaving their jobs, why did the survey conducted by SCC uncover that 81.1% of teachers had their mental health affected, 78.6% of teachers found their work-life balance lacking and 78% of teachers highlighting a longstanding problem with excessive workload?*\*All statistics and quotes were sourced from publicly available resources, with everything else being an opinion of the author and should not be taken as facts.*",Education,-0.9,0.95,0.9,0.9842,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/y3pa63/chan_chun_sings_moe_is_critically_out_of_touch/,Reddit,14/10/2022 9:36

They told me to go AMK or Yishun MRT because those two MRTs have ticketing counter and they could check whats wrong.

t3_yi7uth,Singaporeans who owned HDB (within MOP) and are based overseas,"Hi all,My fiance and I are intending to get a BTO (PLH model) which will be finishing in 2028. However, we have a good chance of working overseas during the same period - an unoccupied flat. As such, we are thinking of renting out our full apartment while we are working overseas which seems to be impossible given the tight restrictions around PLH models: 1) Barred from renting out full flat of PLHs (before or after MOP). We have also found an article [here]( which reported that an occupier had permission from HDB to rent out the full flat (before MOP) as he was working in China, although this is not a PLH model.The next best alternative is to rent out rooms individual rooms which is allowed before MOP. However, working overseas will violate HDB's [T&amp;C]( 8), *both tenants and occupiers must be continuously living in the flat and ""locking"" up a room to return to reside occasionally isn't considered*. If that isn't possible then the last alternative is to be paying mortgage for an empty apartment (while renting a place overseas) - which is possible but financially difficult.Despite the generous subsidies of BTOs, I find it rather hard for Singaporeans working overseas to apply for one - I guess we are a small group and not the intended market. I was wondering if anyone else in this forum were in the same situation, what did you do? Open to adviceEDIT: I should be clear here that I am not trying to game the PLH system.

t3_yzv5tl,Temasek should immediately cease all crypto investments,"From their latest [Statement on FTX (Temasek)]( it is clear that Temasek believes it did no wrong, hasn't learned the $275M lesson bought with public money, and continues to view the crypto space favorably.&amp;#x200B;Here are some tidbits:&gt;The nascency of the blockchain and digital asset industry presents innumerable opportunities as well as significant risks.Nascency? 15 years of cryptocurrency and the only uses are speculation, money laundering, scamming, grifting, and financing criminal activities.&amp;#x200B;&gt;As an investor-owner seeking sustainable returns over the long term, we believe that we have to invest in new sectors and emerging, nascent business models to understand the applications and impact they may have on the business and financial models of our existing portfolio, or be drivers for future value in an ever-changing world. This is why we invest in early stage companies and accept the binary risks associated with such investments.Conflating cryptocurrency and related companies with actual technologies and businesses.&amp;#x200B;&gt;Similar to all investments, we conducted an extensive due diligence process on FTX, which took approximately 8 months from February to October 2021. During this time, we reviewed FTXs audited financial statement, which showed it to be profitable.Spoiler: FTX's auditors are crypto cheerleaders: Prager Metis and Armanino. WTF has heard of them?They are small time outfits with poor track records with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). These two firms in their 2021 reports, did not provide an opinion on the FTX US or FTX Trading internal controls over accounting and financial reporting. Because there were none (..) [More here]( in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls"" - FTX liquidator.&amp;#x200B;&gt;We recognise that while our due diligence processes may mitigate certain risks, it is not practicable to eliminate all risks.Cannot eliminate risk that FTX was a scam, even though they had no proper employee records, headquartered in the Bahamas with an org structure resembling other scams, had no cash management system, numerous complex related party transactions, no boards and board meetings, no proper record keeping of decision-making, etc.&amp;#x200B;&gt;It is apparent from this investment that perhaps our belief in the actions, judgment and leadership of Sam Bankman-Fried, formed from our interactions with him and views expressed in our discussions with others, would appear to have been misplaced.Defends its DD process while saying it's because it mistrusted SBF. So nothing wrong with the DD yeah? Next time just learn to trust founders better. Is that the lesson here Temasek?&amp;#x200B;&gt;Going Forward (..)

Believes cypto space has innumerable opportunities.There are two failings here: (1) Continuing to view the space favorably after all that has happened, and (2) performing very poor DD. This is a $275M hole that could have been easily avoided.

t3_zccnvz,How Singapore helped me realise that I do not want kids,"By most Singaporean metrics, I have a good life. I am able to support my siblings while they're studying, bring my family on holidays once in a while, and have no debt. I don't have terrible working condition or outrageous OT. Yet what we call a good life is far from an ideal life.We are subjected to competition from a young age. Everything a kid does has to be beneficial to applying for a secondary school, to JC and then to uni. That's just the start. We have one of the longest work week in the world and one of the most stressed out workforce. If you're lucky, you get a 45-50 hours, 5 days work week, before even factoring the fact that most people don't get the luxury of leaving the office at the official hour.We are constantly told that we must go above and beyond for our companies, that Singaporeans must work hard and be subjected to competition to remain competitive. Doing just the work that you're paid for is ""quiet quitting"" and is shameful. When someone dared to mention the possibility of a 4 days work week or having the right to disconnect, everyone and their mothers were up in arms about ""the impact on productivity"", even though none of the increase in productivity in the previous decades have been passed on to workers. Let's not forget how we're ""encouraged"" to remain active in old age by upgrading our skills and working more.Houses are getting smaller while at the same time, getting more out of reach for most. If you're not lucky to have found love in your early 20s, have fun waiting for your BTOs. Of course, you could turn to the resale market where all your savings get turned into ~~profit~~ retirement fund for the lucky ones who got there before you (but don't worry, only 1% of people own both a private and HDB property). No one questions why a resale market exist for public housing or why it's doing the job of generating retirement fund, instead of CPF.So, a kid is subjected to stress from a young age, devote his entire life to work, after hours and on weekends, continue to work past retirement, all for a 30 years mortgage on an apartment that should only be big enough to have sex and raise more kids. Who the f\*\*\* looks at this and say ""Wow, this is the life that I want my kids to have"". And mind you, this is a picture of a decent life. God forbid if he was born poor, or LGBT or want to be single.I have since understood the broader ethics about antinatalism which has nothing to do with the Singaporean context. But even if I ignore all ethical questions about having a kid, I could never find it in my conscience to subject a person to the life here.**Edit:** I enjoyed reading the discussion in this post and Id like to address some common points.**1. The idea that anyone who is stressed out must be miserable, maladjusted, entitled or just have not figured things out.**This is precisely the mentality that normalizes the toxic work culture in Singapore and the reason why I would not want kids in this country. People pester others to give birth, extolling the joy of parenthood and living. Yet all solidarity goes out the window the moment someone struggle. Compassion, to these people, ceases when a hypothetical child is born. Unborn children are treated as bargaining chips and economic fodder, not potential people who can experience pain and suffering.**2. Youre just ignorant. Everywhere is just as stressful/Singapore is already so much better than other countries.**Someone having it worse doesn't make your situation any better. It just means the person has it worse. A greater suffering doesnt negate a lesser one. Would you tell a person going through depression that he is ignorant to be struggling when so many others have it worse? More importantly, this rationale implies that its okay subject another person who has yet to exist, to all this suffering, on the mere reason that others have it worse.**3. You can just choose not to be part of the rat race**In the same way that you can just choose to not be depressed? How many cleaning uncles and aunties out there are at their jobs because they love the rat race? Almost no one wants to climb the corporate ladder. We just want time to be with family and loved ones, to develop our passions, to give back to society. How many jobs pay a livable wage, with short work week and long leave?

t3_zdpl85,Unpopular Opinion: Singapore wastes human capital of our youth and sets us up to fail,"Edit 5: TLDR; Aligning the academic year of our MOE schools and universities will give every Singaporean regardless of NS obligations an additional year to work post-degree. An additional year of income at the start of your working life, with compounding potentially translates to a major boost to your savings. This will be a boon for our economy since Singaporeans enter the workforce earlier and get to contribute more over our lifetimes. NS has nothing to do with my point, though a 3-month disruption would do wonders - I am very proud of my SAF service, and nothing will change that - I still carry my 11B around all the time. Those who think I'm salty about NS are missing the point.Edit 6: Please focus on the academic year misalignment in the discussion. The loss is an entire year, not 8 months - the other 4 are spent in kindergarten while kids in other countries have started P1 in August - our children have to wait for January.Edit 7: This is my last edit - my whining aside, I hope people carefully consider the effect of the misaligned academic year on our society. What is the economic loss? Who benefits from the cheap labor of a-level grads waiting for uni? I do not care what you think of me, but please; at the end of the day, I hope you will walk away with the sense that the misalignment of the academic year is a serious issue with grave national consequences that we can actually address through some firm decisions by the leadership; that this is an issue worth advocating.nvm, let's see how sordid this can get. keep the hate rolling guys, I want the karma.Edit 8: To those doubting my age. [ education system has an unconventional Jan-Dec academic year for MOE schools. This forces us to waste 8 months between graduation from school and university. We are a year older when entering university than students from other countries. Add in 2 years for guys who serve NS, and you can see that the average Singaporean throws away 2 years in the prime of their lives into a black hole (1 year for girls and 3 for guys). It need not be the case, especially for the year that is due to the academic year misalignment. I shudder to think of the sheer economic cost of this folly (of course, the impact on individuals is more important here, but as a nation we all suffer from this policy economically).I am 25 yo right now and only have a masters degree to my name, and just 4 months of working experience apart from internships. I tried to make up for lost time, finishing up my bachelors and masters in 4 years. But we're just too far behind. Being in the US, I feel like an utter joke, and I feel like a complete failure especially when my American/Chinese/Indian/European/Japanese friends the same age as me talk about the years of working experience they have under their belt or how they're defending their PhD dissertations. My supervisor at work is nearly a year younger than me. If I go in for my PhD now my advisor may be younger than me (if they're a fresh assistant professor). It is downright humiliating, in a way. Our biological clocks are ticking down, brains become duller and at some point starting a family becomes more important than your career. And MOE wonders why more Singaporeans don't pursue PhDs. We don't have time and are growing white hairs before we get the chance, dammit.Edit: Seriously, guys. The Government wants us to fight for our lunch and handicaps us by putting us in school uniforms when future FTs are in uni (literally). I'm advocating for a realignment of our academic year so that at a minimum, Singaporean women are able to get the same starting line as people from normal countries.Edit 2: I reiterate, this is NOT about NS. Why are Singaporeans stuck in JC uniforms when our counterparts overseas are already enrolling in uni? What is the economic cost of 1 year of earnings \* number of singaporeans affected by misalignment? NS is a totally different issue, but this affects everyone.Edit 3: My failures are my own. I own them, I do not blame anyone for them. What I am advocating is an improvement in national policy; that is, to get rid of the academic year misalignment. Difficult decisions will have to be made wrt resource planning to make this realignment work. But it can be done and will benefit future generations of Singaporeans. Our economy will benefit from squeezing an additional years' worth of work from degree graduates.Edit 4: The academic year misalignment means that schools start their academic years in January, while tertiary institutions typically start at a different time of year. This causes a gap in our educations, the effect of which is we lose a year of working life. Both poly/uni grads are affected, though to a different extent. It also affects you regardless of the path you took to get to poly/uni. If we realign our school system to enrol pri 1 students just 3 months earlier, we can give them an entire year of additional working life post diploma/degree that means more earnings and more savings compounded over the years, and more labor for our economy",Education,-0.9,0.95,0.9,-0.857,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/zdpl85/unpopular_opinion_singapore_wastes_human_capital/,Reddit,6/12/2022 0:29

t3_zmecjd,Sexual assault laws in Singapore,"(TW: graphic descriptions of rape)I did already report my rape to the police last year a few days after it happened, but AGC has decided not to prosecute after a year-long investigation. In asking this, I would just like to know what band of punishment my rapist wouldve fallen under, given the factors. Any theoretical info from lawyers, law enforcement, or those who are familiar with the law would be very helpful. My experience was:- I (23F at the time) had agreed to meet this older man for sex. He was a listed dominant (and I was generally searching for a dom, as a sub). We did not specifically discuss or agree to CNC or BDSM, just that he would be more dominant and that I would be more submissive. - Boundaries on safe words (including stop, no, Im in pain), and gestures (including crying and pushing away, rejecting something) were discussed and he agreed to all of it before we met. - We met, and I realised he had brought BDSM items. - He asked to use rope on me for a BJ at the very start and I agreed. - Proceeding to consensual anal sex, he started escalating to going very deep and rough behaviour. In a lot of pain, I tried pushing him against his hips to get off but he did not budge. Im not sure if he noticed; maybe its why he didnt stop. - I started crying from the extreme internal rectal pain. He stopped and asked me why I was crying. I told him he was hurting me, that I was in a lot of pain. He told me: cry harder, and continued to do even worse while holding my lower abdomen / hips down. It lasted around 20 minutes. I was wailing and sobbing loudly at this point, until i dissociated and basically went into an autopilot, silently compliant state until it was all over (I dont know if legally it means I consented to all of it). - There was a point where I could probably have run out stark naked but I was afraid he would catch me and get more violent. - Subsequently there was slapping, hitting my body with his belt, twisting of my skin, and handcuffing. - When he tried to get me to ride him vaginally, I told him it hurt and got off. He proceeded to hogtie me with rope so I could not move, and penetrated me repeatedly. - Subsequently he put a collar and leash on me, and used it later on to twist and choke me (he also did it with his hands) while sodomising me again in a different position, still extremely painful internally, because I physically could not look over my shoulder to smile at him while crying and sobbing. - Continued to sodomise me while I was crying, wailing and shaking my head as he asked me you like fat (his ethnicity) dick raping your ass? and other questions about being a good little whore for him. - Throughout the 2 hours+ of this, I kept asking for him to stop or for breaks. He pretended he did not hear me until he was finally done with me and said now you can have your break.- 5 mins later proceeded with forced stimulation for a long while despite me telling him to stop.- Wanted to send me to all of his friends to use as a sex slave.- Took photos of me, unsure if he circulated them although police said he likely did not. Some included my blood on his dick and fingers.- I sustained vaginal and anal tears, sprained neck, redness + some mild bruising, and some short-term rectal issues including bleeding. All healed within 13 weeks. Only lasting injuries is developing PTSD. I cant figure out if this was an aggravated rape / purposeful violence (in addition to the violence of rape itself) or not, given the little time it took me to heal from the mild physical injuries, and given the circumstances of arranging to meet him, consenting to the act of casual sex at the very beginning before it escalated, and having silently complied (without verbal consent) to everything else he wanted to do after it did escalate.Will always carry the guilt and self-blame for those grey areas, but thats another story. Does anyone have any suggestions on how aggravated this rape may have been (if at all)? TIA. (Sorry if this offended anyone.)ETA: i am not asking this question with intentions to try and get my case prosecuted. i know there is a serious lack of evidence for this case and have accepted that my case wont be tried, it is also now closed for good (unless of course he gets charges brought against him by another person, which would in turn revive this case). so am just asking out of curiosity trying to figure out how severe my assault was in the eyes of the law, E.g. if its considered aggravated assault, or a Band 1, 2 or 3 offence!",Legal,-0.9,0.95,0.9,-0.9996,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/zmecjd/sexual_assault_laws_in_singapore/,Reddit,15/12/2022 6:36

There was a period of 6 consecutive days where the car wasn't rented out, and I parked the car at my HDB carpark for the first day and it cost me 17 dollars.Thinking of places to park for free, I drove 100m to the stretch landed properties across the road and saw a line of cars parked by the roadside illegally. In the evening, I went to the very end of the road, where there was space for about 4 cars left. And so I left my car there. It wasn't blocking any driveway, and was a good 6-7m away from the nearest gate. I drove it every morning to school to make sure there weren't any ""samans"" on my windscreen. The car was rented out after parking there for 5 days. And it was all over, or so I thought.1 month later, I got 5 mails from LTA to my letterbox, saying that I have parked illegally by the roadside. Each of them carried a fine of $70!! I went to appeal at LTA and they waived my first off, only to increase the 2nd-5th fine to 110 each because ""I had a previous infraction"". Yes, appealing made the total amount higher. Yes, I spent $440 on parking 10m away from a landed property for 5 days. Not cool, but I was in the wrong. I parked illegally.5 years later, I went to the same exact road by chance and I instantly got triggered. I know the house owner hasn't changed, because I took a photo of my car parked there 5 years ago along that stretch of road out of habit and saw the same car there. Using the OneService app, I reported a couple of cars parked at exactly the same place I parked 5 years ago. In under 3 hours, I got a notification that the owners of the cars have been dealt with. I'm not sure if they are able to appeal based on their home ownership, but I hope LTA is strict on their rules. Afterall, that road is public property and it doesn't belong to the homeowner just because he owns the land behind the gate. I parked illegally, and I got fined. Now, they parked illegally, and they should be fined.I'm an extremely petty person and I'm loving the revenge so far. I'm wondering if I should report them daily.

I'm not saying that all prices should increase by just 1% cause there are alot more factors in play such as inflation.

t3_107bcga,TIL: HDB officers never answer phone calls to their office number,"TLDR: If you need help from HDB and called up HDB branch service line, they will probably give you contact numbers (yes, sometimes more than one number) of the officer supposedly in charge. But watch out - these numbers never go through! Instead, you should ask the service line for the officer's office location and go down there!I recently sold my HDB flat to buy a new one, and had to deal with HDB several times due to different hiccups. The lesson I learned is that, the contact number of HDB officers that I got from HDB branch service line are useless. The officers won't answer those calls, some go directly to voice mail, some just no pick-up, ever. There was one time, I kept calling one officer for like weeks, until her voice mailbox is FULL - but still no answer or call-back! This happened again today, the officers number I got from HDB branch service line directly goes to voice mail. Knowing this is a dead-end, I decided to go down to the branch office that I believe the officer should be based in. I went down to the office, I asked the reception lady to help me speak to the officer, and guess what? The lady pulled out her mobile, dialled a number and got the elusive officer on speaker immediately! The reception lady later told me that she called the officer's personal number, not any of her work number - that's how we got to get her. I was also told the officers personal number will never be given to customers, so I will never get to speak to her on my own. Lesson of my story: if you need to find an HDB officer, don't waste your time calling their numbers, just directly head down to their office!Edit: about emailing - my experience with emailing HDB officers is a mix bag, some would reply, some would not. For those replying, it usually takes 4-6 days, which really doesnt cut for urgent matters (when it comes to resale and renovation, most issues are urgent) Today at branch office, the reception lady actually helped me submit a document through her internal message system to the officer, she told me its faster than email. I got a reply from the officer in the afternoon, so much faster than I ever had with any email to HDB! Again, the gist is - when you need truly urgent help from HDB, try going down to branch office, the officers there make things happen so much faster then us calling and emailing on our own.",Housing,-0.9,0.95,0.8,0.9411,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/107bcga/til_hdb_officers_never_answer_phone_calls_to/,Reddit,9/1/2023 10:42

t3_108sm7w,Resale reno electrical problems - how to engage someone to assess/inspect?,"This is follow up to my [ongoing minor nightmare]( with regards to a resale flat's reno. I'm going to spare you guys alot of details because otherwise this post would literally fill your screen but basically the latest - and most serious - defect that we discovered as a nasty surprise is electrical.As briefly as possible: when we first plugged in our washing machine at its outlet it wouldn't power on. Plugged in a phone charger there - it worked. Breakers checked. So we concluded the WM is spoilt. Today I did a bit of handwash laundry and plugged in a floorstand-style exhaust fan to help with airdry. The fan wouldn't power on. After about 10s the whole house tripped. And its not just the inside MCB, the main breaker outside my door also tripped. I reset all of it, went back to test that outlet - it's dead.As you may now suspect - *of course* the washing machine is not dead. The outlet in a newly-reno unit is dead. The (licensed) subcon who did the wiring is also the same guy who's responsible for a majority of items on the defects list, so suffice to say his workmanship is very suspect.I called up HDB to explain the sitch and the guy didn't really offer much except that he would ""arrange for a callback within 3-5 WD"", which isn't much help since it's very near CNY and I'm due to meet the maincon for final handover tomorrow.Q:Who else can I contact to get a professional assessment or testing of the wiring and load capacity in my unit? We have grounds to believe that the workmanship in our unit is compromised. The worst thing that could happen is a fire down the line and this maincon just blame it on some bullshit like 'oh you plug in too many computers' etc.",Housing,-0.8,0.9,0.7,-0.9837,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/108sm7w/resale_reno_electrical_problems_how_to_engage/,Reddit,11/1/2023 2:15

t3_10eyx7v,From crying alone on my 16th birthday to celebrating my 17th birthday with friends - thinkpiece on mental health,"To preface this, I don't know if anyone will read this but this is my pseudo-rant on my ongoing mental wellness. I feel like a lot of people, even adults, fear getting mental health help due to societal stigma, and with the mental health campaigns by HealthHub plastered everywhere nowadays, I felt like this still is Singapore-related. Sorry if this feels like I'm trauma-dumping, I tried to keep it as clear and concise as possible. I was quite severely depressed and had bad intrusive thoughts since I was 15, only getting help early last year by speaking out about my MH struggles and suicidal ideation to a trusted adult. This was because I was scared of being judged by classmates and friends, as I was bullied for being ""depressed"" when I was younger. It took a lot of strength for me to speak up because I felt that I couldn't bottle it up any longer. I felt weak for always being sensitive and an overthinker. I couldn't interact and be social with friends and classmates, as I was always scared of how they will perceive me and I wanted to be validated and loved just like the next person. This took a major hit to my academics and social life. I cried in the school canteen on my 16th birthday because my friends and family forgot all about it. Even then, I only was able to see a psychiatrist and go for therapy after many months and many referrals by the school counsellor and adults in my life. I still felt like crap everyday and made up excuses to chao keng and not go to school a lot because I dreaded it. I am more relaxed now in general waiting for my JAE results. Therapy and meds really changed my life for the better. I found out that I had ADHD, which was the main driving force behind my depression and anxiety, and gave me the answers to why I felt easily overwhelmed in tense situations and why I was so ""sensitive"", as my family always dubbed me. It was not my fault, it was just how my brain inherently reacted to such situations. My therapist also talked to my parents, which led to my dad and mom being more understanding and supportive of my situation for the most part (they still think therapy is for people with ""problems""), and for my dad to better manage his short fuse, and I didn't felt so on edge at home anymore. Don't get me wrong, it's not all sunshine and rainbows; anti-depressants are not an instant cure of depression, I only noticed an obvious uptick in my overall MH a year later. Moreover, I'm still struggling with my ADHD, as I've tried a wide range of very expensive meds and all have not only not helped but hurt me, setting back my progress. Although I'm more outgoing in a sense now, and more social, I still struggle with feeling like I'm truly accepted and loved by my peers and friends. I put up a persona as a funny, chill person, even when I felt like I was wading in deep waters. Up to my birthday yesterday, my intrusive thoughts snuck in and I thought ""what if they really pretended to want to come to my party but ghost me? what if it's awkward and they hate it?"" Fortunately, they all seemed to have a good time, and there were laughs all around. I even got presents, just like I had envied other people who were loved enough to get them. I'm proud of all the progress I have made (my therapist says I'm happier now too). I know I'm incredibly privileged to have such a good support system and parents that can afford the exorbitant costs of therapy and meds, and I emphasize with those struggling to get help because they don't have these. I hate that our society outwardly campaigns for better mental health, but are prejudiced against people who are depressed, autistic, anxious etc. and seek therapy, thinking that they must have severe issues. Most are also woefully uninformed about how depression affects people (see ""just don't be sad! try to think positive thoughts and be more positive lah!""). It's like being trapped in a soul-crushing, numbing black hole, voided of all feeling and fucks to give. It's feeling lonely even when you're not alone. It's the feeling of dread when you open your eyes to see the sunlight streaming through your blinds. The feeling of being a burden to your friends and family. Whydontijustdiesoeveryonewillbehappy..? Walks in the fresh air and the company of friends do relieve that feeling, but I feel like getting professional help significantly helped too. I guess this is my way of saying that the first step to getting help is so hard, but to quote Lao Tzu, ""*the path of a thousand miles begins with a single step*"". The process might be rockier than a Malaysian highway, but the ending is totally worth it.

t3_10kre33,Are dual loop feeder bus services still relevant today?,"This discussion is open to fellow redditors who frequently use dual loop feeder services, as well as bus enthusiasts with any insight into this matter.For context, dual loop feeder services, formerly known as Townlink (SBST/Go-Ahead) or Intra-Town (SMRT) services, provide direct connections between various neighbourhoods within a residential estate without the need for transferring between buses or the MRT/LRT. Such feeder services typically serve the bus interchange / town centre bus stop twice along their journeys, functioning as both a feeder service between neighbourhood(s) and the town centre, and connecting different neighbourhoods within a town together. There are currently 13 dual loop feeder services operating in Ang Mo Kio (265, 268), Bedok (222), Choa Chu Kang (307), Pasir Ris (358, 359), Tampines (291, 293), Woodlands (911, 912, 913) and Yishun (811, 812).Update (26/1/2023): Only feeder services that were integrated from 2 separate feeder services between 1996 &amp; 1997, as well as those indicated as Townlink by SBS/SBST or Intra-Town by TIBS, are considered dual loop feeder services. While there are other feeder services such as 228, 229, 231, 232, 235, 240, 243, 282, 298, 315, 325, 372, 381, 410, 800, 807, 913M &amp; 941 that provide direct links between 2 or more neighbourhoods in an estate, they will NOT be considered as dual loop feeder services for this discussion.In old newspaper archives, the launch of Townlink/Intra-Town services were marketed by SBS/TIBS to ""improve intra-town links between neighbourhoods within an estate"" and ""reducing the hassle of transferring between buses to travel between neighbourhoods"". Some incentives, such as cheaper fares compared to transferring between 2 feeder buses, and the deployment of air-con buses (at a time when feeder services exclusively used non-air-con buses), were also promoted in these articles, both of which have become obsolete with the launch of distance fares in 2010 and a fully air-con bus fleet from 2013.While dual loop feeder services may have been useful when first introduced, are they still relevant today? Here are several issues that come with the operation of such feeder services:**1) Travel Time**Today, travel time is a key factor when commuters decide on the travel options to get from 1 place to another. While some commuters may prefer a direct bus between their destinations, there are others who may opt to transfer between buses and/or the MRT/LRT, if they're able to get to their destinations faster. In fact, the LTA has made transferring between buses and MRT/LRT more lucrative, with the introduction of distance fares in 2010, which calculates fares based on the overall distance travelled by commuters on public transport rather than on a single bus/train ride.Thus, commuters may be more incentivised to transfer between buses or take the MRT/LRT to get from 1 neighbourhood to another today if they're able to reach their destination faster, rather than taking a dual loop feeder service, which may incur more travel time.For instance, 811 provides a direct link between Chong Pang and Yishun Ring Rd, but takes a huge detour via Yishun Ave 6 before proceeding to Yishun South. On the other hand, taking 171/856/859 and transferring to 807/860 at Yishun Interchange to get to Yishun Ring Rd is faster, since 171/856/859 take a direct route via Ave 5, and 807/860 take a direct route via Ring Rd. While it may be slightly more expensive to transfer between buses than taking a dual loop feeder service, some commuters may be willing to pay more, if it means they can get to their destinations quicker.**2) Reliability**As with long distance trunk services, dual loop feeder services tend to be more prone to reliability issues than regular feeder services. When the Peak Period Short Service (PPSS) scheme was launched by LTA in 2014, 11 of the 14 PPSS were aimed at complementing dual loop feeder services.In 2017, LTA took it a step further by rationalising 75% of the trips operated on Intra-Town 912, splitting them into single loop trips numbered ""A"" and ""B"", due to the extended unreliability of the service, despite having 912P (later 912M) to supplement the West loop for over 3 years. While this may have improved reliability on the service, more buses/drivers had to be deployed on the service, going against LTA's notion of ""optimising limited resources"", given that single loop and dual loop trips often bunched on the service.Does this imply that dual loop feeder services would've been less able to meet the peak hour frequencies specified by PTC without additional resources from private operators in PPSS, in contrast to regular feeder services?If LTA had wanted to prioritise improving the reliability of feeder connections (between neighbourhoods and the town centre) over intra-town links (between various neighbourhoods in a town), would it've been better to rationalise dual loop feeder services? This is given that LTA often cites ""the need to optimise limited resources and manpower"" when justifying the rationalisation of parallel trunk services to MRT lines. A similar goal could be achieved if selected dual loop feeder services with lower intra-town demand are completely split back into 2 separate services.**3) Confusion over Boarding Berths for Dual Loop Feeder Services**As most dual loop feeder services call at the bus interchange twice in their journey, it can cause confusion for some commuters over which boarding berth they should board the service at to get to their destinations, especially the elderly and disabled commuters.While SBST has placed route maps at the Ang Mo Kio, Tampines and Yishun Bus Interchanges to guide commuters boarding 265, 291, 293 and 812, these maps may not be sufficient to help unfamiliar commuters differentiate between which berth to board the services at.More prominent markers (e.g. colour coding) should be added to the boarding berths for dual loop feeder services to indicate their direction of travel at their bus interchanges.**4) Alternative Intra-Town Options**Over the 2010s, more travel options have been added to provide intra-town connections within an estate, such as the DTL3 between Tampines East/West. The upcoming CRL1 will also connect Pasir Ris East/West, all of which may duplicate or reduce the demand for dual loop feeder services.In Yishun, new feeder services were introduced, duplicating segments of neighbourhoods currently served by 811 &amp; 812. In particular, the new 807 provides a faster intra-town link between Yishun East/South and West than 811 by skipping Yishun Ave 6.While such trials had limited success, on demand buses were introduced to provide direct intra-town travel within Punggol estate, which could be faster than taking a dual loop feeder service.With the availability of faster and more efficient alternative options for intra-town travel, are dual loop feeder services still lucrative to commuters today?**5) Suggestions to Improve Dual Loop Feeder Services**While there are alternative options for some dual loop feeder services today, other dual loop feeder services may still be faster than transferring between buses, such as 265/268 in Ang Mo Kio. Thus, here are some suggestions to improve the efficiency of dual loop feeder services:a. Dual loop feeder services should be operated as a supplementary link rather than an essential feeder link, if their demand is low. While there are segments of commuters such as students and housewives that use dual loop feeder services for intra-town travel, the majority of commuters are only taking them to the nearest MRT station/bus interchange. As such, frequencies for the feeder connections should be higher than that of the intra-town connections, according to their demand. This does not imply that all dual loop feeder services need to be split back into 2 separate services, or be operated like 912. For instance, trunk services with lower demand can be amended to provide a feeder connection between a neighbourhood and the town centre, which was done with 26 in Chai Chee back in 2016 to complement 222.b. If possible, dual loop feeder services should be made to skip the town centre/bus interchange when travelling between different neighbourhoods. This will reduce their lengthiness and improve their travel time and reliability. There are currently various trunk services that provide direct intra-town links between neighbourhoods in an estate without passing through the town centre, such as 188 between Bukit Gombak and Bukit Batok West.Feel free to provide more suggestions or rebut on the points discussed above.",Transport,-0.7,0.95,0.8,0.9941,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/10kre33/are_dual_loop_feeder_bus_services_still_relevant/,Reddit,25/1/2023 5:45

t3_10ls46r,Meritocracy (and its discontents?),"So, something that my cousin said really struck me (we were catching up during the annual CNY season).His elder kid is gonna enroll in primary school soon, and he is adamant not to send his kid to a neighbourhood school. I probed him further and he says he does not buy the (all school=good schools) mantra. In fact, he specifically moved from AMK to Timah and signed up for the volunteering stuff to buff up his signalling ability for his kid's school admission, similar to what we do in Uni for internships/CCAs.For context, he is doing well in life now, having gotten his masters in Harvard law on a G scholarship eons ago. In my mind, there is nothing wrong for the parent to want the best for his kid, be it getting into good schools, the best tuition/enrichment classes etc. Yet, you have to wonder if the individual pursuit of optimality will lead to socially efficient outcomes.Granted, we do have a litany of social assistance schemes to help the disadvantaged class catch up (e.g. CDAC, MOE FAS, Mendaki). But, and this has probably been said before, I can't help feel that social mobility has diminished since the previous study done in 2012 (see [here]( (There is also an interesting idea on the over-production of elites which paves the way for more instability via [class struggles]( Given how MTI siphons some of the best/brightest microeconomists into the ES, I can't believe there was no policy evaluation done on these schemes in terms of their substance and delivery.Not exactly a question here but I just wonder if there is a final destination for meritocracy x inequality, particularly as we head down the road of wealth management.

t3_10m1jmr,On Raising NSF Pay.,"So, I made a comment a few weeks ago that was downvoted on r/NationalServiceSG \- because the premise basically was Allowances dont have to be raised just yet in light of the upcoming recession and financial situation, something which I do still agree with to a certain extent. I had a sleepless night, woke up and went on a bit of a tangent to consider: \*how much would an increase in allowance actually cost?\* Lets assume now that we are only adjusting Allowances to adjust to inflation rates, rather than dealing with the issue of how ethical being underpaid in allowances is.We must note here that for the sake of clarity that Im not an Economist, Statist nor Political Analyst, and that many of these calculations are estimates. While my opinion will clearly be rather one-sided based on these numbers, I do think that the approach to these calculations can very clearly be flawed, and while I provide a little of my own opined commentary these are amateur observations and may not be as insightful as I wish. Lastly: opposing opinions are welcomed. While where Ill post this is likely to very much support these findings, there are very much valid places to nitpick or oppose the way Ive approached these statistics.**Inflation Rates, and (Proposed) Pay Rises:**Pay and allowance should always be allowed to match Inflation, to allow NSFs to afford the necessities and luxuries allowed to them in recognition of (their) contributions (CMPB). A good estimate of a warranted increase in NSF pay would be to follow inflation rates, of which have been rather high by SG standards with the onset of the pandemic.Inflation Rates in 2021 and 2022 respectively were 2.3% and 6.7%, which isnt really too bad considering COVID and the overall world financial situation. A rise of 7%, which I believe is a pretty realistic sentiment, would be a rise from \*SGD630\* to SGD674.10 for the lowest possible allowance allocated - to standardise everything, lets just assume a $50 pay rise for all NSFs regardless of rank and vocation.**Number of NSFs and Total Cost:**Wikipedia notes that an average of 50,000 people serve NS annually - a number which isnt really realistic, considering Resident Live Births per Singstat indicate 38,000-39,000 Singaporean Babies were born in 2001 and 2002 annually, falling to about \~35,000 p.a in 2003-2005. Halve these numbers for Males only, and being generous enough to round up, 18,500 Singaporean men at birth will enter NS annually. Add another 3,400 new citizens per year serving NS (Source: ST) and rounding up, we get 22,000 Singaporean men serving per year. Doubling that to highlight the total NSFs that would be in service this year, and throwing on some extras for good measure, *45,000 NSFs* would benefit from this pay rise as a super-rough ballpark estimate.Okay, basic maths would indicate that a rise in pay rates would be \~ 50 x 45,000 per month, which would be 2.25 mil per month higher spending, and *27 mil per year* additional financial pressure on the Military budget. Thats pretty expensive, but lets take a look at comparative figures.**(A few) Comparative Figures:*** Janes (A Military Journalism organization) notes that the SAF had an SGD 1 Billion rise in their budget from 2021 to 2022, to SGD 16.36 Billion, a 6.5% increase. This was attributed to, among other things, higher construction requirements, including projects previously delayed by the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, and modernisation plans laid out by the government in 2019 delayed by Covid-19. With some back of the envelope cost calculations (SEE COST BREAKDOWN HERE), the SAF spends a ballpark figure of around $455 Million per year on NSF pay. NSF pay thus makes up approximately 2.7-2.8% of the Singapore military budget. For comparison, the 27 mil increase would, well, comprise 2.7% of the $1Bil increase attributed to the SAF. Such an increase would thus be perfectly in line with the budgetary increases of the SAF.* In 2022, about 23,000 civil servants will get a pay rise of between 5 per cent and 14 per cent from Aug 1 (in 2022) (source: ST), exceed(ing) Singapores core inflation rate of 5.1 per cent (CNA). The main reasons for these pay rises were due to the competitive pay rises in the Private sector, while offsetting the rising cost of living due to inflation.* The GST hike, another reason for the increase in living costs, is likely to bring in an additional SGD 3.5 Billion p.a. by the full increase in 2024. A 27mil yearly increase for NSFs would make up approximately 0.77% of that annual budget increase.From an economic standpoint, I find it hard to justify not increasing NSF pay in light of budgetary and economic conditions. NSF allowances are small relative to the comparative private sector pay expectations - wage-driven inflation should not be a concerning factor given that wages have increased everywhere in Singapore. Even considering that NSF pay could be a privilege, it cant be overstated that with increases in living costs across the board - even in basic necessities such as transport and food - that this expected and thus essential source of income for NSFs should keep up with rising prices. If anything - should NSFs be paid only allowances due to our services being crucial to the nation, shouldnt this minimal allowance be the first to increase, since its already the minimum expected to live on given our circumstances?If NSFs are to be at the forefront of the Nations defense, and expected to serve in light and despite of the challenges introduced by COVID and the economic and political turmoils over the past few years - they should be compensated at \*least\* to the same comparative standards as NSFs of years before. Even if NS cannot be measured by dollars and cents - bus fares, Big Macs and Butter rolls all are, and the prices of those are burning holes in our pockets.

t3_10tf9x5,Singaporeans are getting complacent about risk of extremism,"For 20+ years the Singapore Malay/Muslim community is successful in countering extremist ideology. Measures include licensing/regulation for asatizahs (teachers of Islam) + sermons/material to clarify misconceptions + religious counselling for radicalised Muslim Singaporeans + looking out for those at risk. That is why Singapore not yet kena terrorist attack compared to the communist threat in 1960s.I think this success made Singaporeans complacent about extremist ideology which can also come from other groups:* Many Christians in Singapore kena influenced by Trump like ideology (like the Indian boy who plan to attack mosques).* Many traditional Chinese in Singapore kena brainwashed by China propaganda.* Some liberal Singaporeans (usually with more economic privilege) are becoming more radical and polarising.* Some Malay/Muslim Singaporeans are getting tired of community efforts to counter extremist ideology. More are feeling alienated from wider Singapore society.There are many possible factors for the slight increase in extremist ideology in Singapore:* Impact of pandemic on Singapore society + social cohesion. For example, increase in racism against Chinese in 2020 then Indians during Delta. Many elderly forced to rely on digital media despite limited technical skills + limited media literacy (easily misled by fake news).* Impact of pandemic + inflation (also housing crisis) pushed many poor families to breaking point. To see rich Westernised Singaporeans enjoying life + elitism rubs salt into the wounds.* Extremist recruiters/influencers become smarter to use same psychology tricks as scammers + take advantage of existing fault lines in our society (like language barriers) + target most vulnerable.* Extremism from any group adds to mistrust/insecurity in other groups which can add to extremism in other groups leading to a vicious cycle/multiplier effect (not sure of correct term).Only a small percentage of Singaporeans believe in extremist ideology and among them only a small percentage will resort to violence. But if the above trends multiply the small percentage by 3 (example number) that can be the difference leading to hate crimes/first successful terrorist attack.True stories of two people I know who are affected by extremist ideology (details vague to protect identities):* A close friend from secondary school + his family are traditional Chinese but when they invite me to their place they serve halal food + his parents (Chinese educated with limited English) talk to me in Malay. During Covid his parents start to use Chinese social media a lot for news/music/movies + buy cheap stuff. His mother passed away due to Covid. While he + family are greiving (so burning more but still try to be responsible) kena conflict with another Chinese family over their burning. Then got financial/legal stuff to settle (like insurance/will) but the father don't know how (all in English) and tried to get help on Chinese social media. The father read a lot of China propaganda then kena brainwashed. He keeps telling his children he would support China to attack Singapore to kill all the jiak kantang Singaporeans who want to destroy Chinese culture + keep traditional Chinese Singaporeans in poverty. Even asked my friend to shoot jiak kantang Singaporeans during NS. Friend/siblings don't want to report him because he was a great father for many years + they scared they kena starved if he kena arrested.* A cousin (we grew up together) with special needs who is intelligent but naive + quiet. Pandemic dashed his family's (and mine) hopes of escaping poverty (his therapy also kena disrupted). He recently completed mainstream education (kena bullied a lot) but struggling to find job due to poor economy + racial discrimination + special needs challenges. He spends most of the time on the computer. Few months ago he shared in family Whatsapp group screenshots of LGBT supporters here insulting people who oppose LGBT rights as retarded + comparing them to ISIS. When I found out he surfs a lot of extremist material I told his mother but she said better not report. She thinks with his condition he is not able to carry out any attack + police will not be able to handle him properly. She will try to find an asatizah familiar with special needs to talk to him but is not high priority compared to day to day economic survival.Hope we can take the threat seriously + have a rationale discussion about how to counter extremist ideology.",Housing,-0.8,0.9,0.8,-0.9896,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/10tf9x5/singaporeans_are_getting_complacent_about_risk_of/,Reddit,4/2/2023 12:27

t3_112uqst,How to prevent drivers from scamming you,"Today the taxi meter stopped at $6.15 with $2.30 booking fee. The driver apparently did not stop the meter and it went up to $7.50 after the ride has ""ended"".Called the company and they said price I paid was within the range and since I don't have a receipt, it's my word against the drivers.No problem, I'll just write something online.Here are tips to prevent drivers from scamming you. **If you guys have other tips, please share.**1. If there's no location plate on the taxi, don't even ask if the driver can take you. Just board the taxi. They must take you [according to LTA laws]( If driver tells you to get off, don't close the door. Photograph of the license plate.2. Taxis MUST take your ride at taxi stands according to LTA law. Otherwise photograph of the license plate.3. Always ask for receipt after taxi has stopped. Printing the receipt will stop the meter. No paper to print receipt? Photograph the meter.4. Screenshot when you see ""Driver has arrived"" when driver has not arrived. Use this to dispute late charges.5. Grab app shows rather accurate taxi fare estimates. Use that info to check if you have been overcharged or if there's surcharge going on.6. Don't cancel your ride when the driver ask you to cancel without valid reason. Book from another app, then cancel when the first driver is about to reach.7. I prefer to take taxi through Grab app because they mark out the route taken, which can be used to dispute overcharges (taking longer than necessary route). I was charged extra 10km before and successfully disputed thanks to the recorded route.",Transport,-0.8,0.95,0.9,-0.8173,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/112uqst/how_to_prevent_drivers_from_scamming_you/,Reddit,15/2/2023 10:14

t3_116aqrf,Institutional racism in Singapore,"I'm gonna try to make this as uncontroversial as possible (if it is even possible). Obviously it's a sensitive topic, and people have differing views.But I think by and large, a lot of the racist stuff we see in sg are more societal rather than institutional, like the dude saying interracial marriages are wrong, landlords not wanting Indian tenants, etc. When we look at an institutional level (aka the govt policy), there's very few (or some would say no) overtly discriminatory policies. Any policy that is debatably ""racist"" often has some mildly legitimate reason for existing. Whether you agree with the given reason is another matter, and not the point of this post. But there's one policy I can't wrap my head around that I think is totally inexcusable but somehow not talked about enough. And that is, how the government classifies malays/muslims as being ""less loyal"" and hence deemed to have lower security clearance when working in govt and even during NS. The only argument I've heard is ""what if sg goes to war with Malaysia"". Which makes 0 sense. Because Chinese who were born/have parents from Malaysia are somehow alright. But a malay who has lived here for generations is more likely to betray sg. We even have ministers like khaw boon wan who was born in penang and no one bats an eye.The government doesn't even have a response. I've tried searching it up, and their response just boils down to denying it happens and alluding to not being able to disclose this for national security reasons. Every other policy that involves race, from ethnic quota for hdb, sap schools, grc, or whatever else, there is at least an attempt to justify their position. Not for this.And it has a very real impact. Civil servants and military personnel are literally prevented from promoting because of this. I recall there was a post sometime back of someone being let go from the civil service, with hints of it being due to her security clearance/race. It fits the most literal definitions of institutional racism. It is the state discriminating on the basis of race.Do people think this is a serious problem, or am I just exaggerating the magnitude of this?",Politics,-0.9,0.95,0.9,-0.9617,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/116aqrf/institutional_racism_in_singapore/,Reddit,19/2/2023 13:50

t3_119af6q,Can the government tweak COE policy to make it more fair? Details inside!,"**TL;DR at the bottom!**If someone suggested this before and there was a constructive debate over this, please link me. I can't find anything in recent history.Here's my idea that I hope any sensible MP can bring up regarding our ridiculous COE prices.The whole reason for 'COE' was originally to control the number of cars on the road so traffic is sustainable. Fair enough. Now it's widening the inequality gap between rich and poor. I know rich people whose households own multiple cars. The father, wife, son, daughter, everyone in the immediate family has their own car. 1 person might even have multiple cars in their garage. Bidding for the COE is literally not an issue for them. Even if COE is 200k tomorrow they will snap their fingers and buy a new car because at that point of wealth, the price doesn't matter anymore. Do you think they feel alot of pain when their Porsche costs $900k instead of $800k?Meanwhile, middle and lower income families could really use a family car to settle their transportation needs. The utility value for them is so much more important than the wealthy dude who needs a *10th Ferrari to flex*.**How to solve this?**Why not let every *Singapore Citizen* household (with minimally a married couple, with or without kids), to have their first COE subsidized (can scale according to their income level!) or price capped to something more *reasonable* e.g. $30k? Then, every subsequent car that you want to buy within the household (like if you're getting a 2nd car within the family), the price of that 2nd COE will skyrocket to $200k (I'm using random numbers here btw, you get the gist that the 2nd COE price should be deservedly higher because it's a greed, not a need for the family). If you still want to greed a 3rd car, 4th car, the COE becomes exponentially higher like $300k, $500k. Because a mega-wealthy person that can buy multiple cars without flinching can contribute to the subsidy this way. And a lot of people like that exist in Singapore, just take a walk around Bukit Timah estates. Not even exaggerating here.*It is still an auction system btw - the supply of COE will still be controlled and limited by the govt. LTA can decide exactly how much subsidy they can give to first-timers. The point is to not let the auction spiral out of control due to wealth inequality.*This solves the **first counter-argument** to this proposal - if people want to say the government has to commercialize COE like a business, then LTA still gets their profit - but at least they extract more money from the upper-rich class who insists on having more than 1 car. Households (especially those with kids to fetch) who really need that ONE car will be happy to pay a subsidized fee, and rich families (who really WANT that 2nd car for pure flexing, idk) will also be happy to pay a more expensive $200k COE. I mean, if you're a 'rich' family and you're not happy at paying an additional $100k levy for multiple cars then maybe consider that you don't really need a second car in the first place? The irony right?**Second counter-argument:** you may say that COE prices are sky-high now because of all the private-hire companies buying up COE bids and placing more rental cars on the road - in this case, there should be a separate category for private-hire car COEs. Let all the corporate companies have a bidding war against each other. Let it be a free market competition amongst the corporate giants. Leave us peasants out of it. I really don't care if Grab or Gojek or Tada goes bankrupt and loses the war. With this implementation, the demand for private-hire car rides will naturally drop because most lower and middle income families are able to have their own family car, and we won't see the need for so much parents ferrying kids around in grab. A side-effect is that more people will take public transport too, if the prices of taking Grab becomes too disgustingly high because of this new implementation.**Third counter-argument:** Single people! (I'm single too btw). There can be a single-bid category as well, but I expect this to be as expensive as our current COE prices, being left up to free market forces (*but without the pesky private-hire companies chupping in ofc*). If you have proof that you moved out from your parents home and are living an independent life, you can be decoupled from the multiple car category above. If you have a better idea to this, comment below!**Final counter-argument:** If the household has way too many kids (&gt;4 kids), they may consider appealing to the government for a subsidized COE for a 2nd car due to the nature of having a large family, and this appeal is more likely to go through especially when the kids have gone past &gt;25 years old and are of working age. Anyway, I think this problem may solve itself because if all the kids are finally in the working stages of their life, they can consider getting married and create a new household, thus being eligible for their 1st car subsidy.*I also want to add a footnote that we have an aging population - i.e. lower birthrates and not enough kids to replace parents. Since this implementation should only apply to citizens (PR debatable), the supply of first-time car owners on the road should be decreasing over time, so the subsidy system should be sustainable over a long-run.*Redditors, economists and philosophy PHDs, please feel free to chime in, poke holes in this theory, and explain why no MP ever thought about this yet in parliament :(**TL;DR** COE system should change - 1st car for every family household be heavily subsidized, then any additional car without legit reasons should be slapped with a way more expensive COE to make up for the subsidized ones. The supply of cars on the road will be the same.EDIT: I see good suggestions that the subsidy should be removed, just slap ABSD on the 2nd/multiple car COE owners, which will naturally bring down the price of the 1st car COE owner. Thank you and that was smart.People also mentioned we will be flooded with cars on the road with the subsidy. I dont think this will be the case because we are only asking for a subsidy, not a free COE. Families still have to think twice if they need to pay 50% of current COE price, which is still like $40k (not including the car).",Transport,-0.8,0.98,0.9,0.9903,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/119af6q/can_the_government_tweak_coe_policy_to_make_it/,Reddit,22/2/2023 20:02

I declined and told him that I would call DBS hotline to find out more information.I went to a nearby DBS branch and spoke to the staff there. After a 15-minute discussion and checking my account, they told me that there was no suspicious activity going on. I provided them with the phone number and informed them about the scammer, who seemed very convincing with the local number and localized speech.

The plastic does not just stay in the sea. It breaks down, releasing greenhouse gases that worsen global warming. It chokes and kills a million seabirds and 100,000 marine mammals every year.And ultimately, it breaks down into microplastics and is eaten by fish, crabs, and mussels. This comes back to us on our plates, in our food. It comes back a full circle and our own plastic trash harms us directly. Plastic can no longer be seen just as an environmental problem. It is also a danger to our own health. It must be addressed as an urgent public safety issue.*2) Excessive use of plastic bags are the root of the problem*""We can continue cleaning our shores and continue trapping litter before it enters our waters but we need to move beyond addressing symptoms of the problem. In August, at the Foreign Ministers meeting in advance of the East Asia Summit, the Ministers noted that one of the root causes of marine plastic debris is the excessive use of plastic bags. That is the root of the problem, which we must tackle in order to successfully combat Marine Plastic Debris. If every country just focuses on trapping waste before it enters the waters, we will be combating Marine Plastic Debris problem forever. We need to tackle the excessive use of plastic and I hope that Singapore will take the lead on this.""*3) Engaging businesses to reduce single use plastic items*""In the public sector, the Government is engaging stakeholders to voluntarily reduce all types of packaging waste and cut the use of single-use plastic items. Soon, we will mandate businesses report on the type and amount of packaging they put on the market and their plans for reduction.We also have the Singapore Packaging Agreement, which encourages businesses to minimise packaging waste.""*4) Plastic bags used as household trash*""Let me stress that this is about reduction and not replacement.

t3_122rof1,Fallacies of rent in SG from a landlord pov,"EDIT: formatting sucks im trying to fix it. Embedded Link is supposed to be \[text\](url). **Fallacy 1 - landlords can anyhow raise prices**The other day I felt like doubling my tenant's rent from 4k to 8k. He said ok. All is great in landlord world.No it doesnt work like that.I ask for 2x rent, tenant says he fuck you greedy landlord he cant afford it and moves out. For every week the unit is empty, I now lose 1k in opportunity cost.Offers come in for 5k, but I hold firm at my asking of 8k because \[tiagong\]([ the market is that great. After a month of waiting for an 8k offer, I have already lost out on the 5k had I accepted it earlier, and am paying the monthly mortgage out of my nose.Look, if fallacy 1 were true, I would definitely be charging 50k rent, or how about 2m per month on a small 2BR. Instead, during each change of tenant, it is entirely dependent on viewer interest. When there are few people coming to view the unit, I am not in a position to wait for a higher bid.If anyone can explain how landlords of at most a couple of hdb/condo units can influence the market price by holding firm at $X, given that there are &gt;80 thousand rental transactions annually, feel free to enlighten everyone here.&amp;#x200B;**Fallacy 2 - All landlords huat**Property tax went up significantly in 2023 and 2024. So did mortgage rates.A non owner occupied unit collecting 4k a month pays $5,220 in property tax by the 2022 tax rate, and $7440 by the 2024 tax rate.If rent increases to 5k a month, the property tax in 2024 is $10,800. The tenant pays $12,000 more a year, but property tax has gone up by &gt;$5,000. For perspective, the median income (5k flat) pays less than 3k income tax a year. The government then distributes this tax monies to the benefit of many Singaporeans.Therefore, costs of owning property have eroded a good portion of the profits you imagined landlords were getting, especially those still servicing their mortgage. Mortgage rates have gone up from a low of \~1% to 4+% today. It is not true that everyone has fully paid off houses - even the biggest corporations take bank loans to conduct their business.&amp;#x200B;**Fallacy 3 - Everyone's rent is going up**Rent doesnt work like the normal things you buy at the coffeeshop.Everyone buys chicken rice for $5 a plate, but not tenant has renewed their agreements in the last 1-2 years. Similarly, there are many landlords on 2-5 year fixed mortgages and not paying the 4.x% rate today.No one cried for landlords when rents dipped between 2012 and 2020. The non-landed whole island \[index\]([ changed from 116.5 to 150 between 2012Q4 and 2022Q4 - an annual increment of 2.56%. Within available range, its 4.8% annually between 2004Q4 and 2022Q4. Whatever stories you hear of 100% rental increases, maybe check what the initial price was.&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;I will give 2 real reasons why rent has risen in Singapore. These are never mentioned, and drowned out by \[indiscriminate\]([ calls of 'GREEDY LANDLORD DID IT'&amp;#x200B;**1 - Rentees are part of the problem**Hot take: if you are looking to rent and find prices ridiculously high, it is precisely because of other rentees like yourself. We have young adults who just entered the workforce looking for a sense of independence being outpriced by families or mid career folks, who are in turn outpriced by say some highly paid expats, and the chain goes on.Honestly I wonder how many of those complaining about high rental prices even realize that \[they are part of the problem\]([ Its just like me going to disneyland at peak hours, wondering aloud why the queues are so long and why doesnt everyone else stay at home on the day I'm going.Before you say that every available option in the market is expensive and caused by landlords, thats a supply issue for the government to handle. Landlords don't operate under one hive mind with perfect communication to raise prices together. Rentees are free to boycott prices together, and leave all units empty.&amp;#x200B;**2 - Thank the money printing machine**&amp;#x200B;Lets say there is an isolated village community out there with 10 people. The total money supply is $100 and everyone has $10 to spend each.One of the few tradeable resource is 10 bags of rice, transacting at $10 each.One day the village chief feels extra hungry and prints an additional $900, but the rice supply remains at 10 bags. The traded price of rice will then be closer to $100 per bag.But wait! Somewhere along the way the $1000 is not split evenly between all 10 people in the village! The village chief gets $800, his best friend gets $100, and the remaining $100 is split between 8 villagers.If the village chief wants extra bags rice now, how much will he pay for it?If I am the rice producer looking to sell 1 bag of rice, should I sell to the village chief offering $20 or the other villager offering $12?If you are the villager with $12, are you in a better position to buy rice than the first scenario when you had $10?If the rice producer starts charging rice for $20, the 8 villagers with $12 get MAD! They throw rocks at the rice producer and ask the village chief to put a limit on the price of rice. But who created the problem in the first place? And why would the village chief cap the price of rice when he can easily afford it at $20?&amp;#x200B;In Singapore, across 4 stimulus (Unity budget, resilience budget, solidarity budget, fortitude budget) there was 92b put into the economy between Feb2020 and May2020. I know these came from the reserve so its not the same as the USA printing \[80% of their entire money supply\]([ during covid, but the money goes from the reserves back into the system nonetheless.Just like in the rice example, somewhere along the way this 92b was not split evenly. Take 92b divide by the residents in Singapore and ask yourself whether most people are that much better off. The actual number spent over 2 years is larger than the 92b spent within 4 months of 2020.Who is the village chief, the village chief's friend, and the villagers here?In the real world, the story gets even more complicated. The next day, a neighboring village which has only corn but a healthy appetite for rice, comes in offering $30 for each bag of rice because THEIR village chief printed $5000 to distribute within his community. What happens to the original villagers with $12 now?Who is the neighboring village? Who actually caused the traded price of rice to go from $10 to $30? Is it the person selling the rice?&amp;#x200B;**Closing:**I am just a small homeowner who happens to rent out property, not Capitaland CDL or Far East. Unlike America where there are many corporations buying up residentials for investment (this is for another topic), most of the residential condos and hdbs rented out are owned by individuals. My POV is that the agreed rental price depends on how hot the viewing demand and offered bids are, because these individuals do not control the supply of housing in SG. Again, thats a government problem thats meant to be handled by the segregation of private and public housing.&amp;#x200B;The real greed happened when one of the village chiefs added extra dollars into the system without a corresponding increase in supply of goods and services, and kept it within the hands of the rich.&amp;#x200B;It doesnt benefit me whether or not you believe in the above arguments.

t3_124lpkd,Advice on singapore housing situation (living on rent),"Hello all, need advice/opinion on my housing situation in Singapore.Background: 27yo singaporean, with 50yo+ parents and 2 younger siblings (all singaporeans).We have been paying for rent for the last 10-12 years for a roof over our heads. My parents are immature and have no financial sense, evidently. They have also taken 2 HDB loans before but defaulted on the monthly payments, hence had no choice but to rent houses instead. Needless to say, they have zero property ownership in singapore. As it is known, the rental market has been absurd. My parents live paycheck to paycheck and rent has been very tough. I have been saving up in hope of purchasing a HDB so we can stop moving so frequently, but also because i dont need to worry about my parents being homeless when they cease to work/have income (again, needless to say, they have zero savings for retirement). There is additional consideration for the fact that I have a primary school sibling, who also deserves stable housing. However, HDB has refused to give me a HDB loan due to the fact that they cannot disregard my parents loan count (max of 2) even if theyre listed as occupiers instead of applicants. As i am not 35yo, i also cannot purchase a HDB unit without their names. I understand this is a very rare situation. Does anyone have any input on what is the best way to deal with this situation? It would be great if you are, or know someone, working in HDB that can provide some insight.While I feel it incredibly unfair that i have to wipe out my savings to buy a house for my parents future, which thereby affects my future, but also feeling very helpless that even if i want/intend to do that - the government doesnt even want to help, especially when the whole family is singaporeans.Additional note: yes i have a partner, which is another route to purchase a HDB. No, he doesnt want to buy a HDB with me if its for my family and frankly, it is not wrong for him to take that stance - i do not blame him and agree that will be extremely unfair to him as well. Just want to highlight this, as most people i talked to suggested this.Edit: everyone, thanks for the replies! I really appreciate it and every single one of them. For those who expressed sympathy to my situation, thank you. For all who has provided me resources on what i can consider for my next step, thank you! And for those who mentioned that I shouldnt be responsibility for my parents lack of good financial decisions, I agree and appreciate your comment as not many would have seen it this way due to the filial piety concept.",Housing,-0.8,0.9,0.9,0.9864,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/124lpkd/advice_on_singapore_housing_situation_living_on/,Reddit,28/3/2023 11:23

This wasnt a one off occurence either, there were several times i had to see a doctor in the afternoon and were able to walk in and see one. Makes sense right?Now, you have to book the night before, so that means if you are sick on the day itself, **you have no chance of seeing a polyclinic doctor**.Case in point : I just tried to book an appointment for National University Polyclinics...all slots are already taken. If someone wakes up in the morning, is sick, and needs to see a doctor...they have no chance of getting a slot. GG.In the past, they also had some slots reserved for emergency walk in cases on the day itself. Now, there is no such thing (they explictly told me there is no such thing), everything has to be booked before hand, and all slots are taken up the night before.How have things gotten so bad? I cant afford to get my meds from a private GP because there is no subsidy (CHAS doesnt cover the cost of medications and CHAS orange only covers $10 out of a typical $50+ consultation fee).

t3_128plry,A food delivery guy on an e-bike almost hit my baby in her stroller today.,"I suppose this is more of a rant than a discussion. I want to clarify that this took place at an off-peak hour (12pm on a Saturday) on a pedestrian path where e-bikes are banned. There was a scaffolding that blocked the T-path that I was approaching, and my spidey-senses told me to check before pushing the stroller out. Sure enough the rider on his e-bike zoomed past (at an unregulated speed), and I would certainly have been hit if I had not stepped back. The rider yelled out sorry sorry as he passed with no indication of slowing down. My husband who was behind me chased after him on foot to demand for his phone number. He told me he seemed apologetic and he let him go, where the rider then dismounted and pushed his e-bike until out of our sight.This is where the struggle comes in: because there was no hit / damage, I cant do anything about it. I cant report him as I dont know what platform he works for. I cant get the police involved as there is no license tied to his vehicle, despite a legal ban that was laid out to prevent exactly such incidents. I am not against riders - I deeply respect that they are out there to make their livelihoods, but is your delivery more important the safety of my child, or your own safety? Is the near-miss not enough for you to feel to need to slow down and check if we are okay? Are you going to blatantly ignore this incident and cause a bigger, more painful lesson for someone else or for yourself?Should we have collided, your sorry will not un-scar my 9 month old, or me. Your biggest issue would not be a missed delivery, and both your day and mine would have turned out very differently. Youre still out there making deliveries because I hesitated to push my babys stroller out onto the pedestrian path that I had every right to access on a Saturday afternoon. I dont know what else I can do but to share this incident for more awareness towards pedestrians and riders alike to not take our road safety for granted.Thank you for reading this post.",Public Safety,-0.7,0.85,0.7,0.6031,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/128plry/a_food_delivery_guy_on_an_ebike_almost_hit_my/,Reddit,1/4/2023 15:27

t3_12b6xlk,Road Planning needs overhaul to curb dangerous driving and encourage alternative transport instead of driving,"Even though I primarily get around via a motorcycle, I think more work needs to be done on our roads to make walking and cycling more comfortable, instead of making it more convenient to drive around in as it currently is. Hence why the private vehicle population is staying high even though COE prices keep going up.I believe other than how straight Orchard Road is, I think it ought to be a gold (silver?) standard by which more roads should be arranged in the rest of Singapore.It is an incredibly walkable area with plenty of space for pedestrians and cyclists to share side by side, it is well protected from traffic, and there is still space for green verges. One way traffic reduces the likelihood of accidents though I personally would prefer if they depended less on traffic lights and more on winding paths to control speeds. It also forces drivers to plan ahead and be methodical while driving, lowering their speed lest they miss a turn. It also may make it a decision factor to take public transport instead if the route proves to be more of a hassle.Now look at the vast majority of minor roads in heartland areas. 2 way traffic with Singapore's hallmark straight-as-an-arrow roads, with as many lanes squeezed in as possible taking away space from pedestrian footpaths, making it a pain to walk that 2 or 3 bus stops away to the MRT station to save money AND time even though it is not far, much less cycle it.By just taking your typical 6 lane bi-directional road, cutting it down to a one way 3 lane road that turns off both left and right into respective buildings/estates, we can give pedestrians and cyclist so much more space to move around without coming into conflict with each other. Making the roads wind a bit like they did at Hougang St 21 and several Silver zones have also proven to curb speeds and create jutting pockets we can plant bigger trees for shade.I think we have the building blocks to make more non-trunk roads convenient for peds and cyclists, at the expense of drivers if it comes down to it. But it just annoys me that even though there have been initiatives to retrofit some areas as I've mentioned above, a lot of new roads in new estates are still being designed to make driving in and out more convenient than it is to walk and cycle around, like the new Bidadari Park Drive (though to be fair they included a cycle path on one side of it).Will narrower, winding one way roads affect the bus transportation network? Yea it will, especially if you need to travel along specific routes in both directions. But I sincerely think we ought to be increasing the density of the MRT network so busses aren't such an essential node in the transport system as it is now.",Transport,-0.9,0.95,0.9,0.9251,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/12b6xlk/road_planning_needs_overhaul_to_curb_dangerous/,Reddit,4/4/2023 2:44

t3_12qzca7,PSA to all PRs with male kids or those looking to take on SPR,"Tldr: Please make sure you discuss your future plans as well as the impact of National Service with your kids before signing them up for PR or before their NS.This is a rant/discussion from the perspective of a PR who went through NS without having the maturity to decide for myself whether I really wanted to at the time along side having parents who didnt really look out for what I wanted. Singapore is a beautiful country in its own right, a lot of things many take for granted, but unfortunately it is not a place which Ive been able to gel into well. I came here when I was 7 and my parents applied for PR as a family which we all got when I was 9. Ive been in local school since primary 3 and in that long period of time Ive only been able to make friends with international kids for reasons I also dont fully understand. I worked hard in local school taking the JC track and getting into local Uni for the course which I wanted. I did what I was told by my parents and teachers; study hard and everything would pan out. All this time I wanted to one day immigrate out of Singapore to achieve the life I wanted for myself. I blindly trusted the adults in my life and followed their advice and guidance believing they knew everything and had my best interests at heart.My goal was simple; study local Uni for 4 years then head abroad to experience what else life could offer and eventually retire in my country of birth. But unfortunately that will not happen. I do take some of blame for not reading the fine print but in my defence I was very focused on my A levels when my enlistment letter came. Furthermore I was in the January intake so I had only 1 month before my enlistment to really think things over. By the time I did get cold feet it was 2 weeks out and probably too late. Whilst my NS wasnt bad it left a sour taste in my mouth given how much disrespect me and my fellow NSFs received by regulars aswell as the number of vocations available due to my PR status.The fine print which I missed, which I only found out after A level results where released, was the MOE tution bond. It flew under my radar and I was surprised. I thought the 3 year bond was for international students and not PRs. If I wanted to afford local Uni I would need to push back leaving Singapore until I was 28. I do feel slighted by the bond, having shed sweat blood and tears during my NS to be told Im basically an intl student in the eyes of MOE. Currently I am lost, leaving Sg now is probably the only answer and Ill have to go study in my home country. Which is a shame as I would have been graduating next year if I had just stayed in the first place.I have become quite bitter as well as pessimistic, which is sad looking back at how I used to be. Ive also picked up the unfortunate habit of having to overanalyse everything and the need to find every bit of information myself before making a decision. Ive lost trust in my parents and we argue more than before.I do want to acknowledge that I do have privilege and my issue pales in comparison to what others face. However, this problem could have been easily avoidable and I wish others avoid it. So for all PR parents please do look out for your kids, mine didnt and I have to pay the unnecessary price.Edit: I would like to add that there has been a lot of nuance and history which I simply cant include in a singular post. My feelings are valid and this post isnt an invitation for others to try and correct them. I primarily want to post this because when I was younger looking for info on whether I should do NS I didnt find much out there and seeing this post may have helped me. So I want this post up to share my experience to help inform others kids and their parents.",Legal,-0.9,0.95,0.9,0.8575,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/12qzca7/psa_to_all_prs_with_male_kids_or_those_looking_to/,Reddit,18/4/2023 18:28

t3_134cmol,The COE System needs Serious Reform,"Disclaimer: I'm not a COE Expert, nor can I offer a solid solution, just a guy that got mad about the system and wanted to rant on Reddit.I recently heard about a story of a couple who got married, moved into their BTO flat and are expecting their first child later this year. Since their flat is not near MRT (cannot walk there in 10mins), they decided to get a car. (Not even a good car, just some wheels that can drive). But since COE are stupid expensive and all cheap used cars have their COE expire in less than a year. They are kind of out of luck. We obviously still need to limit cars to avoid deadlock traffic. But I find it ridiculous that a new couple needs to fork out ~$100k for the COE just for the right to own a car. Yes, you can have kids without a car, but one can't deny the convenience of driving 20mins back home from work (rather than an 1hr on public transport) the ease of bringing your kid around without one.The only solution I have is some process that people can go through to prove they need (e.g. children, elderly & disabilities etc.) a car before they can get some COE rebate...Edit: Read some comments and one suggestion everyone seems to suggest is a sort of Ballot System.

t3_137h2xv,Do you think the eligibility criteria for HDB's Enhancement for Aging Seniors (EASE) Programme should be more flexible?,"For those who are unaware, the Enhancement for Aging Seniors (EASE) Programme offered by the HDB facilitates the installation of improvement items in HDB flats to reduce the risk of seniors falling at home when using the bathroom. Examples of these items include grab bars in the bathroom, as well as the application of slip-resistant treatment to floor tiles in the bathroom. More information on the EASE programme is available [here]( the eligibility criteria for direct applications of HDB's EASE programme is rather stringent and lengthy, requiring the household to have seniors above the age of 65, and/or seniors between the ages of 60 & 64 who require assistance with at least 1 Activity of Daily Living (ADL). It also requires 7 working days and the contractor to conduct an assessment of the flat prior to official installation.My mother (age 59) recently suffered a distal femur (thigh bone) fracture while using the bathroom. After the surgery and 1-month rehabilitation in the community hospital, it was determined that she requires assistance in at least 1 ADL for between 6 and 12 months. Thus, the physiotherapist encouraged my household to apply for HDB's EASE programme to implement some improvement items in the bathroom to reduce the risk of my mother suffering another fall. As she isn't 60 years old yet, the HDB requires a Functional Assessment Report (FAR) to justify the need for approve HDB's EASE program, which results in a longer waiting time for the improvement items to be retrofitted.As if the lengthy process of assessing the average household for the implementation of HDB's EASE improvement items is already long enough (i.e. 7 working days), the need for the submission of an FAR to proceed with the application is certainly frustrating, especially if you have a senior at home who's in urgent need of these improvement items.Thus, here are some questions for fellow redditors who have experience with the direct application for HDB's EASE programme, and/or have seniors at home who require assistance with at least 1 ADL:* Is HDB right in justifying having an FAR in order to proceed with an application for HDB's EASE programme for households with seniors below 60 years old but require assistance with at least 1 ADL, but requires the improvement items urgently? I understand how some households may try to game the system during their application. However, shouldn't a senior suffering a fall at home be the best justification for why the EASE improvement items are needed urgently?* Do you think HDB should exercise greater flexibility when processing EASE applications for seniors below 60 years old, but require assistance with at least 1 ADL, by:1. Lowering the minimum age to 55 years old? After all, the risk of falls in the bathroom increases once a person reaches 50 years old, where their bones are more brittle. It wouldn't matter whether the senior is in his/her 50s or 60s once the fall happens.2. Reducing EASE application requirements for seniors below 60 years old who need assistance with at least 1 ADL? Allow hospitals to directly submit the EASE application to HDB with the necessary medical reports for verification purposes, without having the affected household being made to wait for extended periods of time for the approval because of the need to submit an FAR.",Housing,-0.8,0.95,0.9,0.9954,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/137h2xv/do_you_think_the_eligibility_criteria_for_hdbs/,Reddit,4/5/2023 10:54

Ya so many people also coughing everywhere, I also dunno is it they actually got COVID-19.""For some reason he went on to talk about how he's served at various polyclinics and knows all the doctors.Unfortunately I wasn't there and my parents didn't think to record the conversation (not sure if that's legal, but honestly the doctor's attitude and remarks are so shocking I doubt anyone will believe otherwise), but I have every intent of lodging a complaint. I'm assuming Bedok polyclinic will be able to identify the doctor based on the room number and appointment timing. However, I suspect writing to the generic QSM email will just end up in a black hole.I know doctors are generally protected from negligence and malpractice (something something every medical procedure carries some risk; standards too strict nobody will want to be a doctor), and have too many patients to bother with holistic care, but as a healthcare professional (actually any professional) surely basic decency is a minimum expectation.",Healthcare,-0.9,0.9,0.85,-0.278,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/137i626/how_does_one_lodge_a_complaint_against_a/,Reddit,4/5/2023 11:45

t3_13eioyu,Why I absolutely hated being in the Navy (Ex-Regular),"To make things simpler, I have summarized all my thoughts into Cons of being in the Navy. Navy ""Family"": For my ship, not really ah. This was pretty much bullshit the whole time I was there. Didn't even make any friends and felt like an outcast the whole time. Toxic culture and people: The Navy has a reputation for having a toxic culture and some individuals with toxic personalities. Mask lady is a prime example, even though she left service dk how many year back. Honestly, its more like a personal choice a lot of the time. All the officers Ive met have been amazing tho, at least by my experience with them. I really have not a single bad account with any officer. It might just be I am very fortunate and at the same time, I can say I was taken care of super well by officers, even by officers in charge of other departments. Some of them are the best people Ive ever met. The chiefs and ratings, some are messed up beyond compare. Messed up NSF also have but boh bian cos not like we can choose our NSFs lol. I have overheard some of the chiefs talking about the private stuff their guys talk to them privately and telling other chiefs and even ratings about it. I find if Big issue and like really need advice and more people involvement especially if urgent and like really serious is okay as long as give the guys a heads up but my encounter was they were just gossiping. Wtf right. Long/Frequent deployments: Especially the larger platforms like LST and Frigate. In fact, the longest sailing for Frigate during my length of service when I recall is about 3 months. Smaller platforms like MSRV and LMV experience can be even more jialat cos they have very frequent sailings. The biggest reason why people divorce while in service is because they are messed up in some way or they did something messed up. The second is because their spouse and lagi worst, their children consider them as absent. Then they get out of touch and its like the beginning of the end of the marriage alr. Physical demands: One of the things I want to refer to is the rest cycle during sailing. Its really messed up if you have not pass out the requirements. If you are on On Job Training (OJT) which simply means you just posted to ship and your life is super shag. Young Officer also shag but the worst is midshipmen. I really pitied the midshipmen, I always try to help them and share my snacks.. Quite poor thing sia. Always look tired and hungry. As if life not depressing enough, see midshipmen alr can feel even more bad for them and the shit they have to go through No Work-life balance: It is difficult and often times impossible to maintain a healthy work-life balance. I never made any friends within the Navy and my social life during that time is a period where I look back as very unenjoyable cos I just couldnt make long term commitments outside. Duties were a big factor as well as the sailings. Mental health challenges: The high-stress environment of the Navy can lead to mental health challenges such as anxiety and depression. I see too many alr.. Very sad. Really very sad. I also faced so many challenges and people always made me feel like trash and some people really got no empathy and compassio. They can scold and attack a person until they feel so sad that they can go hide somewhere and cry. It is as if people such as myself am not reminded enough that I am not good enough. Exposure to danger: Exposure to dangerous situations. There is more emphasis on safety now so this is like a case by case thing. The ship is a dangerous place, all the structures are made out of solid metal and at times, people can be really suay and they fall down or get cut or out at sea, extremely bad sea state and they fall, all that. But what I cant stand is some cb that dont care and ppl get hurt because of the dumb shortcut or acts they not supposed to do. I was fortunate enough to not get seriously injured but I have seen both people suay and people be lax on safety. Career advancement: It is a lie that the Navy has a well-defined career path with clear opportunities for promotion and advancement. Only after first 3 years where your promotion is guaranteed, the rest is just messy. People can outperform their seniors but their seniors still get to go course first and like nothing wrong when just considering this but the senior also a messed up person and also got past case. Worst thing is the Senior only 1 year difference between the other guy who quite ups. I really dont understand ah A lot had to do with chiefs playing favouritism. Not to mention, a lot of talented and hardworking people leave because they couldnt get emplacement or their career projection is like ridiculously slow. Sometimes is not even people try to pull string, for no reason I got see ppl have their next posting delayed by a year Like wtf what they do sia? End up nothing. Walao eh. Travelling for holiday: Go JB also need to fill up form lol. If your ship on standby and cannot find stand in, suck thumb lor. Worst part is the feeling of missing out and having to explain to family and friends time and time again. Like it really makes you wonder if its all worth it. In my opinion, its not ah. Duty: Honestly the most recurring among worst parts. Duty is just something I never looked forward to. Kena slut until cannot kena slut alr. Money: For a big portion of the middle section of the career assuming if they stay for life, its really small money compared to outside. While people can be really earning big bucks and spending big bucks, what MINDEF offer is really peanuts ah. Really sia what people say about the pay being peanuts after a while is so damn true after entering corporate world. The starting trainee pay is also a joke la. The CPF payments that MINDEF gives monthly on the other hand is very helpful. Quite a solid amount and Idk anywhere else pays that much extra CPF.DISCLAIMER: This is all purely my opinions based on my experience. You are free to form yours but based on my experience, but I will never ever recommend anyone to sign on. You are also free to disagree but I'm pretty sure I have mentioned something you can agree or relate to.ER LOH!!!",Employment,-0.9,0.92,0.7,-0.9705,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/13eioyu/why_i_absolutely_hated_being_in_the_navy_exregular/,Reddit,11/5/2023 9:58

t3_13izzci,This country's mental healthcare system is broken.,"To be concise, this post will only be about the logistical and practical issues in our mental healthcare system, not sociocultural factors influencing mental well-being in Singapore. I already sent a feedback form to IMH, so this is to update fellow Singaporeans about what the landscape is like. 1. **Public hospital: Uncontactable, no accountability, no patient-doctor relationship** When you go to emergency services in IMH and their psychiatrist prescribes medication, they do not leave you with contact information for your psychiatrist. I experienced frightening side effects from the medication they gave me and had nobody to contact. The side effects were not mentioned in the information booklet they gave me. I called IMH, they could not trace my psychiatrist, and they told me to call the IMH pharmacy. I called and the person on the line could say nothing more than ""I don't know, anything about your medicine, you need to talk to psychiatrist."" (Like gurl, I know.) What are patients supposed to do if they have bad side effects? Is the only option to go to emergency services again? This lack of a patient-doctor relationship is harmful especially in a medical field that should be defined by continuity of care and an intimate understanding of a patient's mental state. 2. **Public hospital: Absurd waiting list** The appointment slots they give you are 23 months away. This is unacceptable for people who are in crises or whose mental illnesses are episodic (i.e. people who are usually fine but have moments of great urgency.) A system should be able to accommodate both types of patientspatients with chronic but stable illnesses and patients with time-sensitive issues (losing loved ones, suicidal thoughts, etc). Patients who cannot wait to see a psychiatrist will have to look for private care options, which brings me to: 3. **Private care: No information about Medisave-accredited clinics** There is no information source about where Medisave can be used for mental health treatment outside IMH. There are only articles about how Medisave can be used for psychiatric conditions under the Chronic Disease Management Programme (CDMP) at public facilities or ""accredited medical institutions"", but no follow-up information about what these accredited medical institutions actually are. I found a clinic with a 2018 website update about how they were Medisave-accredited, only to find out after my appointment with them that they weren't. At this point, I don't even know if ANY private clinics are Medisave-accredited. 4. **Private care: No accessible information about cost** Most private care websites do not have information about the cost of their services. You can only find out if you call them or if you visit their clinics in person. This is a huge waste of time for everyone involved. A patient should be able to compare prices and make informed choices for their mental healthcare. Psychiatric consultations are not cheap. They can set you back $400 a pop. We really need to know how much they cost before we make a decision. 5. **Online therapy alternative BetterHelp: Inconsistent, veering towards illegitimate** This is not in our government's purview, but to give you an idea of what an alternative is like, BetterHelp has a dangerously lax definition for what constitutes a ""therapist"". Their ""therapists"" include counsellors without degrees in psychology who practice ""Reiki healing"", hypnosis, or ""crystal therapy"".I understand that we are not entitled to luxurious standards of care with psychiatrists and psychologists at our beck and call, and I understand that sometimes resources are stretched thin in medical infrastructure. What I find unacceptable is that **patients don't even have the information required to make decisions about their treatment**. If they accept that public care is too slow and want to pick a private clinic, they can't tell how much private clinics will cost, and sometimes they're given outdated and inaccurate information. Keep in mind that these patients are, by definition, not doing well mentally, and the more they need care, the harder it will be for them to navigate this confusing medical system. All this will probably be worse for disadvantaged communities, like Singaporeans who don't understand English, or people who don't have the time to do online research.",Healthcare,-0.95,0.98,0.95,0.8888,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/13izzci/this_countrys_mental_healthcare_system_is_broken/,Reddit,16/5/2023 9:15

t3_13lww1p,I snitched on an underaged smoker and,"Just another late afternoon. I was hanging out at a Community Center playing ball with my nephews (Pri Sch) when I came across some male youngsters in their sch uniform from around the neighbourhood. One of the the guys caught my attention as he was holding a cigarette in his hand and smoking away. Obviously underaged. he did 5s and slaps (literally in the face) to another group as he arrived. I felt it was a bad example to my young nephews and decided to report the boy to the NPP since it was just across the street.Inside the NPP, I was surprised to find only ONE police officer attending to someone. He looked at me and asked if he could help to which I told him what I saw. He seemed to know of such incident mentioning it was previously reported the week before but said the post was understaffed and he couldnt leave. He suggested that he could get the patrol police from elsewhere to come down take a look or that I contact the school about it. I told him to get the police down as I knew the school couldnt care less about what goes on outside (I had previously highlighted to the school few years ago but never got a reply. Disappointed). I even showed him a video I took of the boys. Officer acknowledged, got my name and contact and said he might even go over himself when hes done. I went back to join my nephews and the boys were still there. This was when I noticed there were some others vaping. I felt like hey, even if the police came 1/2hr later, they would still be able to find the vapes on them. I continued to play with my nephews for over an hour but to my disappointment, the NPP officer never came. No patrol police came over as well.

t3_13np2sd,"Opinion: The elderly, pregnant and disabled have more entitlement to use ""Priority seats"" than the rest of commuters. Commuters outside these demographics who use these seats do not have the right to doze off/tune out by using earphones.","I commute to and from work every day, with a 1 hour journey each way, so I have plenty of experience observing MRT habits and behaviours. For reference, I am in my 20s, so I am young and (relatively) healthy. I have noticed that it is not uncommon to see young people using priority seats, and often listing to music with their earphones in, or falling asleep.In my humble opinion, people outside the 'priority' demographics do not have the right to get too comfortable in these seats, lest they deprive someone more deserving of the seat of the seat. When you sit in a priority seat, you should always be ready to give it up to someone who needs it more.One reasoning many young people, in my generation, use to justifying sitting in one is ""we should remove priority seats, because it gives the elderly/pregnant/disabled a false sense of entitlement"". The purpose of reserved seats is that it places the primary onus upon people sat in those seats to give up their seats to those who need it more. If all reserved seats are filled with people from the 'priority' demographics, the onus would then shift to people seated in other seats. If there were no 'priority' seats, everyone would wait for someone else to give up the seat, which would not work.More often than not, the priority seats tend to be vacant, while other seats are occupied. I, for one, will usually wait for a non-priority seat to be available before I sit down. When I am seated in other, non-priority seats, I expect that young people seated in priority seats should give up their seats, as those seats are the ones that are, first and foremost, earmarked for those who need it. If they do not give up their seats when there is someone who needs it more in front of them, I would tend to give them disapproving glances until they conform to this social expectation. On the rare occasion that I sit down in a priority seat, I do so with the understanding that if someone who needs it more enters the train car I am in, I should make reasonable effort to give up the seat for them.Many of my peers argue, ""its not compulsory"" or ""I paid the same fare as the elderly"". In a similar vein, it is not compulsory to hold the door open for someone who is right behind you when you walk through it. However, if you choose not to do so, you are demonstrating exceptionally poor manners, and it is more than reasonable that you should expect to be chided for your poor manners. Similarly, if you choose to occupy a 'priority seat' and fall asleep/tune out, other commuters have every right to chide you on your lack of manners.TLDR: Priority seats are for those who need it, if you sit in one (and are not from the demographic who needs it), be prepared to give it up at a moments notice.EDIT: This is not a popular opinion and I'm prepared for the downvotes lol.

t3_13ohhk2,Apparently your polyclinic referral can get rejected by a hospital now,"I didnt know until I called up the call centre and found out a hospital outpatient clinic rejected me due to my RESIDENTIAL ADDRESS not being in the hospitals area. I got the referral from a polyclinic 2 weeks ago and heard absolutely nothing from them, no one telling me I have to find another hospital, no one saying that I was rejected, no one offering additional options. Whats worse is I am a staff at that hosp I chose to be referred to. Its even more frustrating being rejected by my very own workplace that I loyally work for.Seems like the singapore healthcare system is not coping after all.To explain why I am going nuts over this referral, I am on a medication that cannot be stopped. So I need med refills lest Ill turn up in A&E (and be a waste of their resources when this couldve been easily avoided).I myself have taken care of patients whose residential address are not my hospitals area, for example marine parade, pasir ris, sengkang etc. and my own address is in the central-west area of Singapore.-Update: visited the clinic itself who rejected me and the entire counter staff & nurse were in disbelief to hear that my referral to them was rejected. They looked up my record and apparently someone rejected before the clinic could even see the referral. but they are unable to trace who rejected in the system and why. Counter staff said by right there should be a doctor to triage patients referred instead of an outright rejection. Said they will call me back to followup with me. Am still waiting for their call. tldr, unknown person from appt scheduling centre rejected referral before the clinic staff could even look at my referral and triage me.-Update 25/5: Gave up waiting. Went down to their clinic and asked for an update. Counter staff confirmed that the clinic rejected me because I should be going to SGH instead of NUH based on my home address (which is a temporary rental flat btw). I told them to convert me into a private patient instead of subsidised. Scheduled appt on the spot for me. Money solves everything. The end.Update 4 weeks later: IMH randomly called me to say queenstown polyclinic forwarded my referral to IMH I was not informed of this but I let them know that I already made a private appt with NUH..",Healthcare,-0.9,0.95,0.8,-0.9815,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/13ohhk2/apparently_your_polyclinic_referral_can_get/,Reddit,22/5/2023 5:26

For the past week, I've been getting scam/spam calls non-stop since last monday and I have no idea how they got my number. Just yesterday I got 11 calls and i've already gotten 3 today which is really frustrating cause my phone number is being used for work too and these scam calls makes it hard for me to know who are actual customers calling me or not. Cause the scammers are calling from numbers which don't have +65 in front. Curiousity got the better of me and I decided to answer one of them today and not talk at all to see if it really was scam calls or just a persistent survey/marketer. I heard phones ringing and faint conversations in the background, but it seems like the scammer that called me was also keeping quiet like me and ended the call after around 10 secs of this silence.More recently (and less frequently), I started getting whatsapp messages saying ""Hi, is this XX"" and XX is actually my real name and not my whatsapp name which blows my mind cause my phone number and name associated with it is not publicly listed online anywhere (I think so).I tried blocking and reporting numbers, PDPC DNC Registry, Scamshield, etc but they don't seem to work cause I'm still getting bombarded with these calls and messages.

t3_143xfmo,Bus racers,"I noticed bus drivers have a knack of driving faster at night. These drivers have a habit of dashing on the straights and jam brake at approaching bus stops, and at times with standing passengers tripping, or seated passengers slamming against the back of the seats from that sudden inertia.And as our roads are getting less maintained and very bumpy, I can't help but being concerned about road and passenger safety.I understand that bus drivers have a schedule to meet but it shouldn't be that bad at off peak hours at night right? Sometimes they would dash through the journey but still had to stop a few mins at random bus stops, possibly to manage their time. Then why speed at the first place?On the bus, these speeds can actually be quite scary, especially on empty or light loaded buses. Outside the bus, because of the speed they are going, I often miss flagging for the bus, especially at bus stops where vision of incoming buses are obscured by trees of concrete structures.I'm not sure if driver fatigue is a factor. Theoretically, if they drove according to planned schedules, they shouldn't be burnt out at all. Right?That said, I respect the work and effort of these drivers. Their job certainly ain't no easy feat. But I feel there should be a conversation between the bus operators, drivers, and passengers to better improve public bus experience and passenger safety, while better addressing drivers' needs as well.Edit: I decided to re-edit and repost this to reflect the context of my post better after receiving helpful feedback from fellow Redditors.

t3_144wzp6,Anyone feels we are living in Singapore Inc instead of Singapore?,"Just an opinion I had for awhile. I have been hearing a lot about how pace of life used to be slower and all, and it really got me thinking. Before I start, let me just say that I still agree that our government is one of the more competent ones among the world, but oftentimes I feel there are some things they could do better. With the building and closure of so many things, and the more recent Singapore Turf Club, I feel like we are living more and more in a company than in a societyA lot of times I feel the government chases metrics and paper quality. Sorry Im still young and just got into society I might not know the proper words to use. Sometimes a lot of numbers are used to justify certain things. For e.g. prices of items growing at the same rate, GDP highest and what not. But what is not generally measured is our happiness and our way our life. Look at the impending closure of the turf club, another one of our cultural heritage lost. Over the years I have seen so many buildings collapse just to be rebuilt and brought down again. Jcube for example. So many schools closed despite new schools being opened. Every building lost is every part of our heritage and our connection to our country lost. People I asked who were born in the 70s-80s can fondly remember how life was like in the kampong days, or when things were less fast paced. People spent time after work chilling with family or friends, doing the things they like. Holidays was spent celebrating festivals and occasions. NDP was not just a day off from work to watch TV and people marching for a few hours/go JB, but it was a day where they went to catch fireworks, stand by the roadside to cheer at the soldiers marching and performances. New year wasnt another break from work but a day families spent together watching countdown, we still do now but it feels more like a day offPeople here care about work so much that a lot of people I know dont really have time to pursue hobbies and what not. As a society we seem to be focused on work and just work alone. I know it is important to our survival, but a lot of things that relate to our happiness are generally neglected. Rat race they call it. We used to have more public holidays for different religion and racial events. But it was cut to make us more productive. We boast billions, even trillions of $$$ in our reserves, but a good proportion of people generally are unhappy and burnt out. We dont really gather to celebrate anything anymore. Used to see plenty of families at the parks on weekends, events such as lantern festival etc etc, but now plenty just stay at home and rest. Even NDP is just another large light show and performance. A lot of people, especially the younger generation, dont really feel connnected to our country. Its just another place we work in. When was the last time the National Stadium or even community areas was filled with Singaporeans from all walks of life gathering for something. Everything must hit numbers or checklists then considered done. i.e. some designers have to design according to purely a checklist provided by their bosses and not what they feel the design should be. how is that funMaybe I dont make sense, perhaps I might be too inexperienced to know anything, but does anyone else feel that we could do better on focusing less on productivity but more on happiness, while maintaining our productivity at acceptable levels?",Politics,-0.7,0.9,0.8,0.9972,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/144wzp6/anyone_feels_we_are_living_in_singapore_inc/,Reddit,9/6/2023 6:05

t3_14de3mq,PSA: Buy your concert tickets directly at Singpost,"I've been doing ticketing for recent 2023 concert sales and I've noticed somehow the queue numbers can go up to 100k+. This was never the case for previous concert ticketing done with Ticketmaster. I used to be able to get tickets fast under 5min after the sale opened, even without presale. My queue number could be in the thousands but the queue system worked really fast unlike this time when I tried for ATEEZ and The Boyz ticketing. Some people reported having queue numbers of 900k for Coldplay for a PRESALE alone. I have suspicions that this is caused by the people openly promoting and selling bypass links. (Yes, they even have bypass links for presale). True enough, this whole chaos started with the TWICE concert this June with insane queue numbers. Many of the sellers started with selling TWICE bypass links. Some have the audacity to even advertise on Carousell. (Carousell is doing a very poor job at regulating ads on their platform.) These bypass links generate multiple user sessions which creates these high website traffic. Normies who don't have the links will be stuck in the waiting room while people who have the links can land directly into the seat map page. Someone accidentally posted THREE bypass links in a groupchat I was in and I could access the ATEEZ ticketing page immediately. Meanwhile, my original queue number of 30k was still stuck in the waiting room after 30min. I tried for The Boyz ticketing 2 days later and got a queue number of 70k at around 12.10pm. When I accessed Ticketmaster again at 1.45pm, there was no queue and the first & second floor was not sold out. So where were the 70k+ people who wanted to buy The Boyz tickets? To add insult to injury, scalper wannabes will snatch a ticket and spam group chats asking for 'help to buy' commission of $15-40 on top of the ticket price. Yes, these people are snatching tickets just to earn $15. Not just kpop concerts are affected, even the Charlie Puth concert is being targeted. I can't think of any other way to circumvent this mess unless the whole operation of selling bypass links and Singaporeans buying gets shut down. Or if Ticketmaster SG puts anti scalping measures in place (doubt). So if you want good seats for future concerts, just queue at Singpost or prepare to pay scalpers.",Public Safety,-0.7,0.85,0.6,-0.9716,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/14de3mq/psa_buy_your_concert_tickets_directly_at_singpost/,Reddit,19/6/2023 13:02

t3_14fztu7,It's time for concession pass reform.,"I expect this to go poorly considering that much of /r/sg's demographics are school going and thus best placed to benefit, but this has to be said.Many, especially university students, will note this particular peculiarity in the concession pass system, where it is significantly cheaper to use only one mode of transport:Pass | Cost---|---Bus Concession Pass (BCP)|$55.50Train Concession Pass (TCP |$48.00Hybrid Concession Pass (HCP)* |$90.50source:  doesn't just apply only to university students; we can see this at work for poly students (who famously, for quite a while, paid the same fares as uni students and not that of their A-level counterparts). In fact, it also extends to primary/secondary school students, though the very low single trip primary/secondary school fares means most in this age group don't buy passes anyway.# The problemThis pricing system is largely unchanged from the 80s and the 90s where the bus companies were individual operations and SMRT was also a separate thing. Your parents may recall this as the farecard era where one had to pay separate fares every time changing between bus and MRT, and that transfer discounts were only a small discount off the overall fares.This might have worked in the old days, but with the [LTA's introduction of Distance Fares in 2010]( we are now at a point where it is possible to ride a bus for free after an MRT ride.The MRT network is also expanding, but we can't build the MRT everywhere nor can we run buses everywhere. The expansion of the MRT will mean that more people will be asked to make trips involving both bus and MRT, a trend that can also be seen in [Census 2020]( where 25.7% of respondents used both bus and rail modes of transport compared to 17.7% in 2010.Under the current concession pass regimes, imposing such a requirement basically asks these groups to double their spending on public transport, because where previously they can buy a much cheaper bus concession, they are now forced to purchase the much more expensive hybrid concession.# Benefits of a passThis is mainly more for university students and NSmen, who pay adult fares otherwise and only gain access to the discounted passes. The situation is similar for senior citizens, but they don't have these single mode prices. Senior citizens get a single pass at $64 ([introduced in 2014 at $60, since increased]( that allows them to have unlimited rides on both buses and MRT. Likewise also new in 2014, normal people may apply for the Adult Monthly Travel Pass, that gives unlimited bus and MRT rides at $128 today. Yes, this is a raw deal for a lot of people.For the $128 pass to pay off, it is necessary to spend $4.27 a day on transport, every day, for a month with 30 days. For reference, the highest possible fare payable is $2.26 for journeys above 40.2km, equivalent to travelling from Pasir Ris to Tuas every day (not even Boon Lay or Joo Koon). For a 20 day work month, this increases further to $6.40.On the other hand, a university student who can make the $48 MRT pass work for them (more likely for NUS or SMU kids, less so for NTU) will only have to purchase the pass if they can spend more than $2.40 a day on public transport. It's much easier to reach a $2.40 cap than a $6.40 cap.The most negative effects of this can be seen in NUS, where what I must assume are train concession pass holders all flood the free ISBs, whilst bus 95 sees much less use even when it passes by the same places. [The ISB Man wrote a post]( exhorting people to take 95, but based on what I'm seeing of 95 it seems to fall on deaf ears, probably because much more people use train concession + free ISBs so can't benefit from the transfer rebates.# What should be done?**One can't help but ask the question on whether the mode-specific concession passes should be removed, and prices of the hybrid concession passes for tertiary students should be dropped down to $64 to align the policy with what is offered for senior citizens.** Other categories of students can also follow suit with just hybrid passes at a new level below $64.By removing incentives for users to stick to a certain mode, we can more efficiently provide public transport especially where our MRT network is expanding with the TEL and other rail lines; the growing MRT network inevitably results in cases where MRT trips used to take a bus, like [the many Bukit Timah expressway routes and maybe even 36 in Marine Parade after TEL4]( We can also more efficiently use buses in certain places (such as 95 and other ""free bus rides"" pairs) to distribute people coming off the MRT/LRT, especially in places like Sengkang and Punggol.",Transport,-0.8,0.95,0.9,0.996,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/14fztu7/its_time_for_concession_pass_reform/,Reddit,22/6/2023 10:29

t3_14k5ejg,MA experience in Singapore,"Didn't really see a lot of posts talking about medical abortion in Singapore and being someone who went through a lot of fear before the procedure, I wanted to be able to shed some light on what the process was like. English isn't my first language so please be kind :')&#x200B;After self-testing with a test kit and obtaining positive results (panicked a lot here), proceeded to make a next-day appointment at a polyclinic to get a referral to KKH. My appointment time was for 12 pm, but the wait at the polyclinic was around an hour. I then had to wait till 2 pm to go back again to do a urine test to double confirm my pregnancy, which returned positive as well. Doc double-checked whether I needed more time to consider but I was very sure that I wanted to abort, so she gave me a referral letter and checked with me whether KKH was alright. 2 days later, I received a call from KKH and obtained an appointment date for the Friday a week later, which is considered relatively fast compared to the usual 2 weeks wait.&#x200B;KKH Clinic C's layout is a bit weird, so if it's your first time going there, do note that you should sit facing either the counter or the consultation rooms, and not at the seats near the entrance as the queue number display is different (I missed my appointment time because of that even though I reached very early). &#x200B;Whole process took about 4 hours in my case. First station was the counter, where the nurses aren't the most welcoming nor the best at confidentiality since they were just speaking at the top of their voices without attempting to help us keep our abortion confidential. They proceeded to pass me some forms and instructions on what to do and where to go after. Then I had my weight, height and blood pressure taken in a room (I didn't have to take the urine test again since I already did it at the polyclinic), then proceeded to the ultrasound area to do an ultrasound. There was about a half an hour to an hour wait for the ultrasound, which the doctor there was really nice and gentle with me (10/10). We then waited to see the doctor. &#x200B;When it was our turn, the doctor re-confirmed with me my decision to proceed with abortion and asked me which method of abortion I preferred. Being the indecisive type, I asked her the difference between the two and she provided me with some pamphlets and explained the pros and cons of both medical and surgical abortion which I really appreciated :') The earliest date for medical abortion was the Monday after, while for surgical it would take up to 3 weeks. We're both broke kids and since my partner offered to bear the costs of the abortion, I decided to go with the cheaper option i.e. medical abortion. Medical abortion is also better in terms of it being less intrusive and thus less severe consequences if anything were to go wrong, but if the pills are unable to clear your womb completely, you might still have to go through a surgical abortion. The doc also told me about the various contraceptive methods for me to decide on after everything is over.&#x200B;After the consult, I had to proceed to wait for mandatory counselling in another room. Huge shoutout to the counsellor for not being judgy, but instead very motherly and kind to me. She showed me a mandatory video to watch (of which I don't really rmb anything abt since I zoned out), then told me about the various contraceptive methods as well, and told me to not get any more abortions because it's really bad for my body :'))) She also said that my partner MUST wear condoms and I should ask my partner to put spermicide on the condoms as an extra precaution LMAOOO. Anyway, I heard a lot of bad stories about the mandatory counsellings but I was really glad that I met a counsellor that understood that I wasn't ready and didn't have the means to raise a child.&#x200B;Anyway, I had to proceed to payment first before I could get my blood taken for blood tests to be done :((( The nurse that took my blood was really professional tho so it didn't really hurt much. After the blood test, you're good to go!&#x200B;P.S. Since the waiting time between each station took so long, I researched more on the two abortion methods and wanted the surgical abortion more, so I had to wait till 2 pm to see a different doctor since they change shifts. The nurse assistant in the room was just so bloody rude and started scolding me for changing my mind because she would have to process the refund back to me which was very mafan and I'm like ?????? Anyway, I decided to stick with medical abortion even though I really wanted surgical because yeah, we are broke. SAD.&#x200B;The Monday after I went to Clinic C again and waited about an hour for the doctor to arrive just to swallow the first pill in front of the doctor. We were then told that we can go home directly so yeah. On Wednesday I had to go Urgent O&G at 6 am, where I was admitted to a C ward. They provided a bag of essentials that contained our hospital gowns, sanitary pads, disposable underwear, wet wipes and the blue blood absorbent pad thingy. There was also this thing where u had to place on the toilet bowl every time you use the toilet in case you pass out any blood clots. I then changed and waited for the nurse to insert the remaining two pills into my vagina. Shoutout to that nurse as well, she was the MVP coz she had to insert so many pills into so many vaginas, but she was still very sweet and called me darling :')) Prescribed 6 antibiotic pills and 4 painkillers after breakfast which I think helped a lot because I barely felt any pain (or maybe it was the new iPad system they implemented where there were games on it and I played Sudoku all the way while waiting to pass blood clots LOL).&#x200B;Visiting hours are between 10 am - 8 pm, so my partner came over once it started. Around 10.11 am, I passed out the fetus (still wasn't bleeding till then) and pulled the emergency cord to get the nurse to check on it. Passed out some more around 12.30 pm as well, and I think that was when I was clear. Doc came around 2.30 pm to do a scan to ensure that there was nothing left inside, and if all was clear you can go home on the same day at 5 pm. If it isn't clear, you'd have to have two more pills inserted every 6 hours until you're clear and you can't be discharged on the same day.&#x200B;P.S. Pain was alright, it felt more like the pain I usually feel when I'm having diarrhoea during my periods. I did have heating pads to help though, so that probably helped with pain management.&#x200B;Post-procedure bleeding is expected up to 10 days, but honestly, it's been 14 days and I'm still lightly bleeding, will update again once it stops I guess.&#x200B;Hope this helps!",Healthcare,-0.7,0.95,0.8,0.9952,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/14k5ejg/ma_experience_in_singapore/,Reddit,27/6/2023 6:16
t3_14kcf2b,My NS Story,"Due to making this Abit private I'll give in general what happened. Ns started for me a few years back was excited for ns due to the fact they turn boys into men. That's what I thought on my younger years was too positive, optimistic and curious. To me the sense of an adventure of my life to actually grow as a person actually when down into a spiral,that still haunts me as an adult. When I entered,everyone had that pokerface due to unknown reasoning I didn't care at first, I was a happy lucky guy. 3 month of bmt, was fun I didn't mind the physical torture but the verbal bullying not from my sergeant or my officers but my own peers constantly criticize me everyday. I knew I shouldn't give in , I was mentally strong back then tbh I didn't have any grudge or drama on them I just vibe or exist. Till one faithful day personal life goes to sht went to camp with that same constant harassment slowly chipped my mentality. I suck it up for a week till I kinda broke down. I informed my officer, sergeant and the head of my COY what happened. They told me if I would give their name so they could charge them but I refuse out of the kindness I had when I was young but naive. So they assured me they will try to control the situation so I continued. But as usual they used that opportunity to talk behind my back but I kept quite.....Till posting day, I was posted to a unit that was small but they were actually fine and dandy people nothing much happened here because this was my one of best time in ns.(Pls not I am not admin)Till I was posted somewhere else afew months later, Well here is the second part of this spiral this one really effected me mentally, physically I was I punishing myself to train my body harder to samewhat vent out my thoughts. The moment I stepped into this unit I knew I was kinda Fuqed. My old unit mate told me the unit that I am going to has a lot of snakes/hantu(backstabbers). They would pry on you when your working then what every happens during work they would tell the officer. I was shocked the officer condone such actions not only that only a selected few could go inside the office like we are segregated. I didn't know how to tackle such people I just played along, my mental state when down slowly when they asked me to do the same was not a fan of it. So I was qoute lucky enough to be accepted into the office but I didn't care much cause such title like that is kinda childish. The people in the office would ask on of our nsf to buy food outside but the others that are not in the ""office"" can't get their fare share. So as retaliation I cooked my own food and bring to work everyday. From then on they targeted me. Constent work harresment like if I am printing something I can't stand up cause my officer gets irritated, I make one mistake on my excel but could undo it the snake would sabo and cry about it constent stuff most humans with a brain wouldn't give a fuq too.But imagine waking up everyday to this sht is draining then god's grace, personal say fuq you then my mental health dwindled. I was holding my emotions the entire time during my time there. From there on I Fuqed up becauses I couldnt control my pent up emotions ends up in db(justifyable) but sht man I was going through so much and did so much to make a change in that unit till I went to db I realized that unit doesn't deserve to be helped I did my best to prevent the worst from most of my peers that were outside of the office. They indeed were thankful for what I did for that I was happy to hear.Went to DB met my childhood friends fun people but poor life decisions wow look similarities, we are 2 peas in one pod I would say 12 peas cause I knew all of them. Was actually better then my unit I enjoyed db we sang we talked about regrets gave each other extra food. Kinda missed those days when we used to be together. Well fun time must end so we progress to my day of returning to my unit was happy cause I had actual fun so that day went alright. Next day, what did you know same work harresment again plus talking behind my back same sht didn't care at first then boom god gave me another fuq up in my personal life but unlike the previous 2 this was the worst. I started to hate myself, pushed my exercise till I was panting with exertion. I grew more depressed seek medically but I didn't want to be diagnosed with it. I was sure I would push tbh I don't see depression as a bad thing I see an opportunity to grow as a person.

t3_14p7l96,Ableism in Singapore: Awareness post,"Prior to my illnesses, I was super healthy and didn't see the things I see now (the discrimination against the chronic or disabled community). Ableism in Singapore is very apparent and often dismissed or gaslighted. Some its out of convenience by using the sole resource (e.g. lifts, handicap toilets) or blocking access, others maybe they just don't realize and there's systemic ableism too (lack of inclusive playgrounds). If racism, elitism, sexism is not acceptable and not tolerated plus no one gaslights them for their lived experience, why is ableist comments or behavior tolerated?I'm gaining my strength back now and want to use my lived experience to raise awareness that these are not okay. Some examples I can think off my head are: * Telling someone that they are not really handicapped or making fun of their handicap by saying its their fault* Creating obstacles on pavements or ramps (e.g. pots, bins, motorcycles, bicycles, pmd)* Gaslighting or dismissing lived experiencesLet's not discriminate anyone because they are different (status, race, gender, disability) from you or I.

t3_14pnnmb,"Going overseas to seek inpatient mental health treatment? (working,studying,holiday,medical tourism?)","Actually this topic has been on my mind for quite some time. It's because I have harboured thoughts of working/studying overseas - but one point that my pdoc has brought up is always the lack of social support/how I can rely on my parents in SG(which I find is utter rubbish as my parents don't provide much emotional support and getting hospitalised in IMH in a crisis really sucks)But can this be mitigated with good insurance? I remember that I wanted to go overseas for my final sem at my private uni, and they told me about comprehensive health coverage, including medical repatriation in case of emergency.Yes, in the USA/UK, they have funding cuts, people thrown into prison instead of mental hospitals, too few mental hospitals for people, long waiting times and yada yada. But you have multiple hospitals for mental health, and it's not centralised like IMH and some other wards in general restructured hospitals - so you can probably choose a hospital instead of being warded in IMH c-class wards against your will.I mean IMH is pretty shit for inpatient hospitalisation, and I know peers with BPD who were kicked out from the more conducive Mood Disorders Unit(MDU). Plus, each person may spend 1 month in MDU, making it hard for other people to use the facilities.Also in Australia, you have short-term crisis centres where you can rest there and recuperate instead of going to a hospital.I digress, looking at Britney Spears, I believe due to her A-list status and her being rich, she would never be thrown into one of those third-rate psychiatric hospitals in the USA. Probably UCLA or somewhere conducive for recovery. I guess it's the same for rich people anywhere in the world. They can probably check themselves into Mount E, but if you get sent into IMH, good luck.Digressing further from this topic,some people with chronic mental health illnesses have benefitted from a month's sabbatical overseas, ie. homestays or backpacking trips.So I would like to hear your thoughts, whether you are a healthcare professional, or a person seeking mental health treatment on how feasible/unfeasible is it to seek mental health treatment overseas esp when you are working/studying overseas. Or perhaps medical tourism etc? Or if you are there on a holiday and happened to relapse?This is probably quite a touchy topic. I mean, some may argue that at least having beds in IMH helps to ensure that lives are saved, instead of people becoming homeless/people committing suicide/going to jail aka USA. But then again, some may argue about the right-to-live/right-to-die and how people overseas have more freedom of choice.For me, based on my personal experience, my stays in the C-class wards have been so traumatising that I would prefer not to be saved. I have had recurring dreams in the past where I was hallucinating/going out of control and the ambulance sent me to IMH. Some dreams were super peculiar, ie. sitting on a yoga mat in a dance hall, ie. strapped to a stretcher and staring out of the window with nothing to do. The theme is always about having nothing to do.I know there's the Short Stay Unit and they are trying to improve their services and all, but I am not sure if they have the budget/infrastructure to really revamp majority of the wards? You can argue about why there's no specialised ward for personality disorders also since they would benefit the most from therapy and less of medicine - more and more people are getting diagnosed with BPD every year and the incidence is catching up with depression. (Maybe some commentators might try to armchair diagnose me based on this statement) Or you can argue that only a small majority of people benefit from MDU/EPIP so far.TL;DR; Going overseas to seek mental health treatment(inpatient) as a skilled worker, as a student or as a tourist with a relapse or even maybe medical tourism - is it feasible? What are the barriers?Ps. I stayed in Sayang wellness before and NUH. Would rather be in a c class ward/b2 ward with decent facilities to save money. People stayed in Sayang for one month ended up spending 10k. I was only there for 7 days, thank God. and Sayang only for stable patients, heard Mount E is even more ex than Sayang but ok with suicidal pts. I also visited people on mdu before. Tbh I rather be warded for a physical condition in c class ward than imh acute c class ward. At least I can use the phone n I won't be shuffled back and forth. And maybe they will give me opiates or painkillers to make me drowsy instead of being alert and restless af. I have stayed in the holding area in general hospitals due to medical complications for suicide attempt and I prefer that experience prior to ambulance transfer. The ambulance transfer really fucks with you. You think u are going somewhere nice but reality hits. So when ppl talk about going c class for physical illness if no insurance rider etc, I call bullshit on this one. No air con won't die, but IMH c class ward really fucks with you.

This is why the US has such a high rate of road injuries/death - in the early days, planners believe that building wide straight roads in non-highway use cases (stroads) will reduce the room for error and make it safer. But such accommodating road designs just encourage faster driving which result in higher fatalities.Singapore has plenty of stroads. Upper Thompson Road, Sims Ave, Yio Chu Kang Road, Upper Serangoon Road, etc. They are so easy to speed on because they are so accommodating to cars. Its such a shame because Sims Ave and Upper Serangoon Road could have been such interesting streets, lined with shophouses, but instead they are human-hostile stroads with 4(?) lanes of traffic and tiny narrow sidewalks.Hypothetically, if our roads looked more like central Londons, or Manhattans, we would probably have a lot fewer accidents and casualties, because the roads inherently discourage speeding. How do you speed when the road is narrow, twisty, and short? Im not saying we should replicate Londons roads, but this is a trade off that is worth considering.

t3_14xd8bd,KTMB Train Pricing,"Been reading about taking the KTM train from Woodlands to JB, and one of the tips is to buy the 'To' ticket separate from 'Back'. If you were to buy a round trip tickets from SG, will cost you 17.50rm x2 = 35rm. If you split them up1) one way SG to JB is 17.50rm2) one way JB to SG is 5rmTotal is 22.50rm. Here come the interesting part. If you were to buy a round trip ticket starting from JB, it will cost you only 5rm x2 = 10rm. This mean I could potentially game the system by1) Buying round trip tickets from JB to SG and back for only 10rm - but taking only the SG to JB train; wasting the JB to SG leg 2) one way JB to SG is 5rm.Total is 15rm which is cheaper than a single ticket from SG. Not sure if anyone tried this? If yes, apology for leaking this cheat code. And potentially leading to a waste of tickets.

So this happened in between lessons, (we booked practical and theory) but I was walking with my friend to our next lesson and after our pract he needed a smoke. We saw a whole group of instructors at least 20 of them smoking at the carpark corner, far away from anything( basically we were not inconviencing other public nonsmokers.) I pointed out that since we had to quickly rush to our theory, why not just take a quick smoke break here instead of walking all the way out to the entrance and then back in again. Anyways even the instructors are doing that here. But then when my friend walked over, lit up his cigg, an instructor with his vape, comes over and politely tells him that he can't smoke here and that this place is for instructors only. Albeit, in nice manner. But it ticked my friend off since they were all smoking here anyways. Idk, to me, if you're gonna have rules that say you can't smoke in the compound then shouldn't everyone have to follow it?

t3_156zmfd,"Raj Naga, friend of police officer Uvaraja, posts on the incident on Facebook","Copied wholesale from FB:My friend and former colleague Raja passed away on Friday, 21 July 2023. I am told that he ended his life wearing his full uniform and operational kit. He had sent me a 4 minute long voice message that afternoon. I was out with my family, and I was not able to respond to him immediately. By the time I could call him back, it was too late. When I listened to his voice message in full later that night, my heart broke listening to him desperately crying about everything he had faced in the recent months. I could hear the despair and anguish in his voice. I will forever bear the cross for not calling him back immediately. At the end of the message, he bade me farewell and asked me to tell the truth about what he had faced.Sgt T120387 Uvaraja s/o Gopal was a highly disciplined police officer who was deeply passionate about policing and fighting crime. He had a distinctly rigid sense of duty, and he held himself to very high standards of behaviour, turnout and bearing even when he was off duty. He was very clear that his calling as a Police Officer was to serve the public, and not about pleasing his superiors. He never once smoked or drank alcohol, was an avid runner and was always fighting fit. He would regularly share videos with me of incidents involving police forces around the world for us to discuss. Everything that I am about to share is what I know to be true based on my interactions with Raja and what he shared with me in my capacity as a Senior Paracounsellor at Ang Mo Kio Police Division.I first met Raja when he was serving his National Service as a patrol officer in 2007. I remember the team he served in was filled with officers we now call legends due to their crime busting skills. This is where he was inspired to become a regular officer. In order to sign on after completing his NS, Raja spent some years obtaining the qualifications needed. He conducted his own physical training to obtain a gold IPPT standard just so his application would stand out. In 2012, he fulfilled his dream and was posted to Ang Mo Kio Police Division.I recall he spent a number of years in a plainclothes unit when he joined as a regular officer. Sometime around 2015, he was transferred to patrol duties to Ang Mo Kio North Neighbourhood Police Station. At the time, I had a secondary appointment as a Senior Paracounsellor at Ang Mo Kio Police Division. In Dec 2015, on his own accord, he approached me seeking help with some issues he was facing at work, and I officially took on his case after referring the matter to my Chief Paracounsellor. As his assigned Paracounsellor, my duty was to provide a listening ear and guide him towards developing his own solutions.Raja faced difficulties at work, leading to anxiety attacks and trouble sleeping. He was also caring for his mother who was recovering from a brain injury. In early 2015, he argued with his Team Leader over a racial slur and reported the matter to his Commanding Officer (CO). However, he faced conflicts with his teammates who did not back him up and the Team Leader was not held accountable. He felt ostracised by his teammates and his request to transfer out was rejected. During this time, he faced sleep and anxiety issues, took no-pay leave to care for his mother, and underwent two surgeries for a lump on his leg and a deviated septum in his nose.In December 2015, Rajas CO recalled him back to the office whilst he was on medical leave and questioned the validity of his medical conditions, used vulgarities against him and shouted at him to resign. This incident stressed him, leading to an investigation against the CO. He sought to transfer to another department and was assured by the Division Deputy Commander that it would happen. However, his morale dropped when he received a low performance grade, and his transfer was turned down. Due to his continued medical conditions, he incurred repeated medical and no-pay leave extensions until April 2016. He communicated his distrust towards management to me, and I referred his matter to the Police Psychological Services Division.During this time, the Division Commander attempted to have Rajas employment terminated but it was rejected on the grounds that his medical condition was genuine. The Division Commander then referred him to the Internal Affairs Office for investigation in Dec 2016 for not staying indoors during medical leave, despite the fact that Raja was actually on no-pay leave. That investigation concluded with no further action being taken against him. However, the stress of the baseless investigation and the prospect of returning to the same CO worsened his morale and sleep troubles.I struggle to relive the bitter memories and the sheer abuse of authority he faced. It is a testament to Rajas strong resolve and mental fortitude that he endured the prolonged surveillance throughout his recovery from his surgeries. But there is only so much that the human mind can take. What is mind boggling is that despite all the reports made to higher management, Raja was posted back to the same CO who continued to be abrasive towards him long after I had left the force.Raja used to tell me his motivation to succeed was so that he could look after his wheelchair-bound mother, who suffered from long term physical and mental ailments. I still have a message he sent me in 2014 when he described growing up with an alcoholic father who left him and his siblings in debt. He had to work part time as a car washer for school pocket money when he was 14, and he was confident that he would overcome the setbacks at work to make something of himself.From here onwards, these words are purely my opinion.Raja may have made mistakes during his time in the force, but who hasnt? Everything he ever did as a Police Officer was in pursuit of ideals that he held dear. In a perfect society, his sense of discipline and professionalism would have been desired and rewarded. Unfortunately, in my opinion, he destroyed his career when he first blew the whistle against his superiors. No officer deserves to be held back and thumbed down for so long. And yet, it happened.When I first became a Police Officer, I was taught to always hope and pray that my colleagues and I would have long, fulfilling careers without injury or death. From the day we start training, we hear stories of officers who have either died in the line of duty or died by their own hand due to the stresses caused by the nature of the work. Somewhere along the way, we stop looking out for each other, and become obsessed about our own career. We are paralysed by invasions into our privacy, silenced by fear of repercussion, and turn deaf to the voices crying out for help. Raja left us wearing his full operational uniform. He embodied the ideology of C.L.I.F for as long as he could. He showed Courage in the face of discrimination, he was unwaveringly Loyal to the force, his Integrity never faltered even when he was shamed, and his Fairness towards his fellow officer was not reciprocated.

t3_157xrug,What's your biggest takeaway from Ridout Road?,"For me, one big question remains unaddressed despite the many hours of Parlimentary time spent on the issue. Shanmugam is the Minister in charge of SLA. He is also a tenant of a state property under the SLA's purview. In other words, Shanmugam manages his own landlord. He sits on both sides of the transaction - landlord and tenant. But these interests are diametrically opposed. It's not just about how he bidded for the property and how his bid was accepted. The conflict of interest persists and is incurable for as long as he remains (1) the Minister in charge of SLA, and (2) a tenant of SLA-managed properties. Let's remember that the rental of cushy bungalows like Ridout Road is not some kind of essential public good. So let's not be distracted by analogies of the Minister for Education sending his kid to a public school, or the Minister for Health visiting a public hospital, or the like. This is about the Minister in charge of the agency managing very expensive properties, whose monthly rental exceeds the annual salary of many Singaporeans, deciding to rent one of these expensive properties for himself. I've always liked black and whites, he says.Imagine if you were in his position. On the one hand, you manage SLA. On the other, you're a renter of Ridout Road. When it comes to things like reviewing rental prices for state managed properties, are you going to hike rents in a red hot market, or find ways to minimise the rent you personally have to pay every month? I may have missed it but was this issue ever ventilated in Parliament? Why is Shanmugam being allowed to remain in this position of actual or apparent conflict of interest for as long as his tenancy lasts? Or unbeknownst to us, has he actually recused himself from all matters relating to state properties for the duration of his tenancy? I certainly don't think I saw that reported in the news.What do you all think?",Politics,-0.9,0.95,0.9,0.9817,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/157xrug/whats_your_biggest_takeaway_from_ridout_road/,Reddit,24/7/2023 2:32

In light of the death of SGT Raja alleged to be due to a toxic SPF working environment, I felt that I have to post this to let people know my experiences in SPF. I am writing under an alias account to protect my identity. Lets see if SPF would doxx me, in hypocrisy to their own laws. This is a story about a broken employee grievance system, written to warn those considering joining this organization. This is my story of my experience in SPF. No names or sensitive information is shared in adherence to Official Secrets Act. Whilst I was being posted to investigation branch, another departments IOs warned me about the department I was being posted to. They talked about the toxic people and manager there. At that time, I didn't believe them. As my police tours started, as seen on CNA documentary, I was in charge of handling phone calls on cases from NPCOs. My teammates would work on other tasks. Going in fresh, I did not know what to expect. I asked my allocated mentor what I should look out for when picking up calls. He said, when you become more experienced you will know. Later on, I asked if he could demonstrate how to handle the phone calls, he picked up one and demonstrated how fast he could handle a call and ended the call within 20s. There was no explanation that came after. This would be his modus operandi for many of his future 'teachings'. With this, I went on tours without the basic explanations on what I should be doing even when I asked. During the course of my tours, I tried to ask my teammates on the tasks and cases, but many denied to share information and told me to ask my mentor instead. People were not forthcoming in sharing knowledge Knowledge that was essential to do my job. In addition, there was no proper orientation. Every time I needed a document or resource to do my work, I had to go beg around for them. In contrast, other departments have starter packs with documents to get them started. Their teammates were forthcoming in sharing. I envied them. As I naively believed that the phone calls were about speed, including making decisions as my mentor had demonstrated so, I tried to pick up all the phones calls that came during tour. As a result, I was overwhelmed. I only found out much later that my teammates were supposed to help pick up the calls. But sadly, they did not inform me or offer to help. They certainly did not notice something was amiss when they were getting little to no calls. As a result, I was making mistakes in my work. I kept forgetting stuff as I got overwhelmed by calls during tours and outside tours. As I made work mistakes during tour, some of my teammates began to say: if you don't know something, you must ask. In my thoughts, I was thinking, I did ask but I get bounced around or get nonchalant answers except from a few people. This is just my bias, but I think in the private sector, people would know better. They would know that those with experience have to also play their part to share. The repercussions are that during tour, I made some decisions and some did not work out. I then get blamed for them. Generally, there was a stance that did not tolerate mistake which one can argue to be both good and bad. I raised the issue on my mentor to my manager. I told her in a nice manner that my mentor was not really teaching me the things I needed. Based on my impression, my manager talked to my mentor to take corrective action. At first, things seemed to get better, because my mentor would sit down with me to explain a subject that was essential for my work. However, this only happened once. The nonchalant teaching continued afterwards. If I did not ask, nothing is ever shared or taught. But to be fair to the manager, she did try to share some teachings. Am I supposed to know what to ask when the information is something that is privileged to those with experience? Work mistakes continued. With the overload in work, I continued to make mistakes during work, including typos. I was also blamed for not coping well. Thankfully, there was a teammate who was kind enough to share the resources that his own mentor shared with him. If not, I could not even do my basic work. However, as my work performance was not improving, my manager became more and more abusive. She became fiercer and fiercer in her interactions with me, sometimes shouting my name fiercely out from her room. Months later, she would also fiercely tell me to get out of her room and to leave her department. Hostile interactions continued as she gave a black face during our interactions, including when I greeted her in the morning. (The boss made all sorts of micro-aggressions too, not like she recognize them) At some point, the narrative that I did not ask has become entrenched, even though 9 out of 10 times I can assuredly, based on my conscience, say that I did. I asked to the best of what I could, without the privileged information held by the mentors. (I was even blamed later for asking about everything. Just how self-serving can these people get?) Later on, I found out that my mentor was covering his ass by speaking poorly about me to my manager. Given that she is, in my opinion, a Machiavellian covert vulnerable narcissist who cannot take disagreement, it was clear that he was agreeing with her own views on my incompetence to protect his position. One month in, I sat with my big boss to tell him that I wanted to change department. He dismissed my concerns, showing a lack of interest. The next day, when I was back in the office, I was shocked when my boss angrily told me off for talking bad about her to the boss behind her back. Since when did sharing concerns about a manager become bad talking? That was when I knew that what I told my big boss was being conveyed to my manager. I still remember her saying fiercely: I hate people who talk bad about me behind my back the most! Given the fierce backlash from trying to raise an issue, one would be mad to raise issues to the big boss. So I tolerated such a department. A few months in, when I finally found out that I was not supposed to take all the calls from NPCOs during AIO tour and told my manager, she blamed me for not asking. This blaming continued even though she said at the start with such gusto to me that there will be no blaming in this department, after making negative assumptions that I was blaming someone for a case that was passed down to me, that was not done well. Deteriorating treatments continued, and my mental health deteriorated. I was getting dark thoughts. I sat down with my big boss while censoring my words on my manager and I was referred to PPSD for therapy. I knew this had to be done because I knew something would happen if I did not leave this department. This time, it was my big boss who said, why didn't you tell me? In my mind, I was thinking, you were conveying what I said to my boss, and it only leads to blaming and scolding. You think I would be able to tell you? I would only be shooting myself in the leg. Nine months in, I was finally transferred to another department. I ceased my therapy then as the colleagues there were friendly, professional, and forthcoming with their sharing and I was able to do my work well. Some of the work is even more advanced than my previous work. At one point, I handed in a file that was well done to my big boss. There, he asked me, why is it that you couldnt cope previously? That was when I could confirm, he didnt really care. Whilst I was in the new department, the commander held a no supervisor chat with the employees. Before I went to the talk, I was clearly told to send the minutes of that chat to a supervisor, who was not supposed to be there. Ultimately, I did not send those minutes out to the unauthorized supervisor. But at the same time, I could not raise my issue or give my true feelings about the organization to the commander as that information could be leaked. I am sure my colleagues felt the same, given their lackluster response. Ultimately, I decided to quit SPF, given how dysfunctional the organization was. There was no procedural justice or any effective form of grievance handling of verbally abusive managers. One year later, I still get dark thoughts. During one such attack, I wrote in to a minister to look into the matter. Action was finally taken. Info was sent to the divisions feedback and IAO called me. I thought something was finally getting done. I thought that someone was finally going to recognize that there was a problem here. What happened during the interview was not pretty. I felt that the Internal Affairs Officer had deemed me to be a troublemaker, saying that he knew that the big boss had engaged me on the matter even though I said that he did not. However, in truth, my discussion with the big boss on that matter in the entire nine months did not exceed ten lines. Okay, maybe twenty lines just to be generous. He told me that the big boss did a lot of things for me behind the scenes and asked if I know what had been done for me. I told him that I did not know what actions had been taken. This was my honest perspective as the management only communicated within themselves. Nothing was ever shared with me. No one informed if action was taken against my manager. No one engaged me to ask me more about the problem that I faced in my department. If they did engage anyone, I can only speculate that they talked to my manager. Weird isnt it? When someone raise an issue, they do not try to learn more about the issue from the person raising the issue, but talk to the manager and ask her opinion on the person raising the issue. What kind of organization does not ensure the anonymity of the persons raising issues? The internal affairs officer asked why I did not seek counseling or treatment after. I told him I was doing alright in the new department. I was also thinking: after I left, I didnt, because I would have to pay for my own counseling and I was not employed for a year already. During this year, I fought hard against my dark thoughts using self-help cognitive therapy. After a year of investigations, the internal affairs officer called me and said that they did not find my boss behavior to be excessive. This was verbatim. I told him that some of the people I know had left SPF people whom I know were in the new department which the manager took over. He told me that people were leaving en masse from the public service not just SPF. So, instead of trying to fix the problem, SPF buried it and condoned it? That is what I thought. Given how negative the initial portions of the interview were by the internal affairs officer, I could only speculate how SPF processed my provided information when the minister forwarded the information to the feedback department of the police. I speculate that my division and my manager got hold of the information first, gathered information from people in my ex-department. If that was the case, how could the investigation and information gathered not be biased? The manager herself would be exerting pressure on those providing information. The same goes when the IAO officer was interviewing witnesses. Did the witnesses have to provide leave of absence with supervisors, and was there any pressure exerted onto them to be politically correct, given that the manager has rank and position? And this concludes my story. I am trying to move on with life, trying to find positive interpretations of growth and peace to my dark thoughts and all the gaslighting. I considered suing SPF but it would take a toll on me financially, emotionally, and mentally. I am writing this post because I believe people need to know what they are getting into when they sign that contract with SPF. They need to know that some parts of SPF are rotten and that one may experience a department and division that do not care about the mental wellbeing or the procedural justice that pertains to employee grievance. These structures may exist on paper, but are sorely lacking in reality. SPF would surely disagree given how well the persons involved can cover their asses. I would like to end off by asking people who are looking to join SPF, not to believe my words at face value because this story is just my perspective, but to think critically for themselves, talk to friends who left SPF and see what their experiences are. Not just look at the rosy pictures painted by yearly advertisements. Be sure to give careful consideration to the monetary bond for those who sign on. With all that is said, my conscience is clear. I have been blamed for not being resilient, not coping with my work, being unsuitable for being an IO, and having poor job fit, but I know better. I produced high quality work on complex cases that was recognized by my colleagues and manager at my new department, thanks to proper mentoring in the new department. I know better than to be gaslighted. All that I have posted here are my personal perspectives. I am sure SPF would vehemently disagree given that the letter they sent me (portions attached below) had disavowed all legitimacy of my claims. After all, despite providing some evidence on chat, they have found no evidence to substantiate my allegations. Now, after two years of fighting my inner demons, I am taking a short course, with many thanks to skills future (kudos to the government on that) to pivot industry. I hope that everyone would be able to find workplaces that are not abusive and workplaces with functional employee grievance systems. I am merely sharing my story because I believe people deserve to know. Be careful joining an organization that is so good at managing impressions. If they can with their conscience look at me and say that there are no problems, then so be it. The symptoms are all there. I fully empathize with the experiences of SGT Raja because I have experienced similar dysfunctional management where the big boss sides with the boss and there is no form of effective grievance handling in the force. There is no form of 3rd party investigation or whistleblowing within. You raise an issue against your colleague, your colleague will know. You raise an issue against your boss, your boss will know. They will then beat you down like they have done so towards me, like during the initial portions of the IAO investigation. Own self check own self. This is the consequences. If you are thinking that this story sounds ludicrous, I am thinking the same. IAO officer got the guts to say to me on the phone that his investigations revealed that the managers treatment of me was not excessive and that SPF was losing a lot of people just like the other parts of public service, but got no courage to put it down on the reply he sent me. I can only conclude that the investigation was slipshod, biased towards the manager and never really finding out why I couldnt cope. I can speculate that all sorts of problems are buried in this manner. I challenge SPF to send my investigation file and SGT Raja's for audit by a truly independent body, or even better, open those documents up for public scrutiny.",Employment,-0.9,0.95,0.9,0.6321,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/158ty2b/redditor_shares_experience_with_toxic_work/,Reddit,25/7/2023 1:41

I am sure SPF would vehemently disagree given that the letter they sent me (portions attached below) had disavowed all legitimacy of my claims. After all, despite providing some evidence on chat, they have found no evidence to substantiate my allegations.Now, after two years of fighting my inner demons, I am taking a short course, with many thanks to skills future (kudos to the government on that) to pivot industry. I hope that everyone would be able to find workplaces that are not abusive and workplaces with functional employee grievance systems.I am merely sharing my story because I believe people deserve to know. Be careful joining an organization that is so good at managing impressions. If they can with their conscience look at me and say that there are no problems, then so be it. The symptoms are all there. I fully empathize with the experiences of SGT Raja because I have experienced similar dysfunctional management where the big boss sides with the boss and there is no form of effective grievance handling in the force. There is no form of 3rd party investigation or whistleblowing within. You raise an issue against your colleague, your colleague will know. You raise an issue against your boss, your boss will know. They will then beat you down like they have done so towards me, like during the initial portions of the IAO investigation. Own self check own self. This is the consequences. If you are thinking that this story sounds ludicrous, I am thinking the same.IAO officer got the guts to say to me on the phone that his investigations revealed that the managers treatment of me was not excessive and that SPF was losing a lot of people just like the other parts of public service, but got no courage to put it down on the reply he sent me. I can only conclude that the investigation was slipshod, biased towards the manager and never really finding out why I couldnt cope. I can speculate that all sorts of problems are buried in this manner. I challenge SPF to send my investigation file and SGT Raja's for audit by a truly independent body, or even better, open those documents up for public scrutiny.",Employment,-0.9,0.95,0.9,0.8654,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/158u6hl/redditor_shares_experience_with_toxic_work/,Reddit,25/7/2023 1:51

Singaporeans have been fooled by mainstream media - The Online Citizen Asia,"by Philip AngOn 19 July, Ng Kok Song, former GIC Chief Investment Officer, announced that he would run for president in Singapore.According to our mainstream media, Ng had concerns about integrity of our national institutions.Ngs rags-to-riches story was also reported by the foreign media.While the former GIC CIOs concerns may be justified by the recent record scandals involving Peoples Action Party (PAP) ministers, Singaporeans should also be aware that he has been part of an opaque PAP system during his entire career, ie no transparency with regard to investment of state reserves, non-disclosure of top executive remuneration, concealing information which should be in the public domain, etc.1. Recall that GIC had invested almost US$17 bil in convertible securities of only two banks UBS and Citigroup while global share markets went into a tailspin during the 2007/2008 global financial crisis.GIC was investing mostly in Central Provident Fund retirement funds, and this was totally reckless because the number of toxic assets in the banks books was a known unknown.Yet, GIC went ahead and made the two biggest bets on these two banks in 2007/2008. If the US govt had not bailed out Citigroup by reducing the exercise price of Citigroups securities, GIC could have lost an estimated S$10 bil.Ng Kok Song was the reckless GIC CIO.[What do you think? ]",Economy,-0.8,0.9,0.8,0.1215,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/15d52ww/former_gic_cio_ng_kok_song_an_independent/,Reddit,29/7/2023 22:38

t3_15hb0yw,"Trust in the system, not in the people","I've said this before on numerous occasions, and it's a position I've held deeply over the years. The recent political scandals, on both parties, have really highlighted the significance of this statement.We shouldn't expect our politicians to be perfect. They are only human. They err, they make mistakes, they suffer from moral failings, greed, lust, etc. That is not acceptable and there should be consequences, but it's unreasonable to expect that it will never happen.That is why a robust system built on legitimate checks and balances is important. Giving the PAP carte blanche because ""it is more efficient than constant politicking"" is trusting that PM Lee (or whoever his successor may be) is not corrupt, and has the political will to clamp down on any wrongdoing in his party. And even then he may not be aware of everything going on.In Iswaran's case, we are fortunate that PM Lee consented to CPIB's decision to investigate. What if in a future scenario, a corrupt PM says no? Sure, CPIB could go to the president, but let's not fool ourselves that the president is truly impartial, with all the rigging of the rules of the PE and having an unelected committee decide who is eligible to even run for president. More likely than not, the president would be an ex-PAP inner circle member - like in the case of Tony Tan, Yacob, and likely Tharman.It is dangerous to place the collective trust of the nation in the hands of such a small group of people. I believe that PM Lee and soon to be PM Wong are righteous people who do more good than bad overall, but I don't want to put all my eggs in that basket. Things can change in the future. Instead of trusting that they - and their successors forever - will always be good, I would rather trust the system to keep them in check if they ever turn rotten.",Politics,-0.6,0.9,0.8,0.9897,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/15hb0yw/trust_in_the_system_not_in_the_people/,Reddit,3/8/2023 17:55

I satisfy all requirements.**I have seen multiple comments on other posts in this sub and even rants on social media regarding this issue, so I would like to create an official post about it.First and foremost, I would like to ask you guys for your opinion, whether the previous Assurance Packages and COL payouts fall under Government Benefits in this sentence that is extracted from ([ signed up for Government benefits (e.g. past year's GSTV) In my opinion, it does belong in the same category of Government Benefits, hence moving forward, I thought that no action should be required on my side, since my bank account details have already been made known to them, when I had to input the details in the same portal for the past Assurance Packages. Even in my SingPass inbox, it was even stated that those previous payouts were paid to my PayNow-NRIC linked DBS/POSB account, including the last 4 digits of my bank account number.I contacted the GST hotline yesterday, and was told that those who just turned 21 this year had to ""sign up"" for the GST Payout by the 10th of July 2023. This ""signing up"" process is just inputting of the bank account details, something that I have already done last year for the AP. I would say that only if I had a change in my bank account details, then it would be necessary to update the details, otherwise they should stick to whatever is already in the system.What's frustrating me more is that, I have not receive any official reminders via my SingPass inbox, or even a physical letter sent to my household, to remind me and the others who are in this situation too, that we have to ""sign up"" for this GST scheme. I know that you guys would argue to me that I have to do my due diligence to check all of these stuff online, but it does not hurt for them to send out these official notices to serve as reminders.I know this payout is definitely not a lot to most of you here in this sub, but it really matters to those who come from lower income households.

So first things first, i work in childcare and mentioned it to my doctor in charge. She told me twice that she would provide me with 6 wks HL. She probably considered that preschool teachers have to bend and move about the whole day, even pick up cots etc. When I got discharged from KKH, my auto sms sent to me only mentioned HL till end August which is barely 4 wks which was sent by another doctor. It was signed by another doctor so i though nvm, i will explain to the doctor when we do follow up and the doctor will extend another 2 wks.I checked my healthbuddy for follow up appt date and there was none, tried following up on the app to email in and ask about follow up date explaining the situation... and today I got the date of my follow up appt. It's the 19th of September. So KKH expects me to go back to work on the 1st and then work till the 16th and then come in for follow up on the 19th and perhaps give me two more wks of HL if I ask I guess.

t3_15nj3ap,"Opinion: High COE prices isn't the problem, the problem is that people are still willing to pay for it","I know the title is a little paradoxical, because COE prices are not set by the government but precisely by what people are willing to pay for it.But in my opinion, the fact that wealthy people (or people willing to take crazy loans) want to pay so much for a car is emblematic of a more troubling issue - that cars are perceived to still be the best mode of transportation.I have previously posted a few opinion pieces related to car infrastructure and urban planning, some which are a lot more well-received on this subreddit than others, and this is in line with those. As a land-scarce city, we should aspire for true car-lite urban infrastructure. That does not mean physically limiting the number of cars on the roads, but designing infrastructure and policies in such a way that people don't want to drive.For a lot of trips in Singapore, driving is still faster and more convenient than public transit. Excluding the initial capital outlay of purchasing a car, it's also not much more expensive, as Singapore has very cheap parking by international standards. This leads to 2 problems: 1) people who can afford cars want to buy cars, 2) people who already own cars want to drive cars.We need to design urban infrastructure to not accommodate and prioritize cars as much. That means dedicated cycling lanes, more bus lanes in residential areas, and more road diets for cars. We have excellent public transit, but we arguably have even better car infrastructure. Public transit should not be something you take because you can't afford a car, it should be something you want to take because it is overall a better experience.I don't know if this is possible, but I think it is something we should strive towards. The top cities in the world where people commute by non-car modes don't have COEs. So clearly, it is possible to design cities in a way where people don't want to drive. Anecdotally, I have coworkers in NYC who do own cars (because they moved from car-dependent suburbs) but rarely drive, because driving is simply a worse experience than taking public transit.Personally, I enjoy taking public transit in Singapore a lot - I don't have to think about traffic, it frees up time for me to read, it's inexpensive, it's clean, and there are no crazies around unlike in some other cities. My only gripe is that buses are slow and regularly stuck in traffic, and I wish I could be zipping through bus lanes and bypassing all the cars on the roads.",Transport,-0.7,0.95,0.8,0.9825,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/15nj3ap/opinion_high_coe_prices_isnt_the_problem_the/,Reddit,10/8/2023 17:43

t3_15o5i8y,Since this is topical: Bus lanes should be 24/7,"Singapore has 3 different types of bus-lanes: peak hour, full-day (which excludes nights and sundays), and bus-only which are in force 24/7. I think bus-only makes a lot more sense:- If there's congestion, then buses should be given priority- If there isn't any congestion, then other vehicles don't need the extra lane anywaywhich is simple reasoning for this. The main benefit of bus-only lanes over peak-hour lanes is that they help buses pull out of bus bays. Even if the road isn't heavily congested, when there's a mild stream of traffic, buses still have to wait in the bay for a chance to pull out. Our buses spend a lot of time stopping so it's important to cut down on dwell times.In fact, in bus lanes it makes more sense to build in-lane bus stops (i.e. buses stop directly in the lane) rather than bus bays, but most of our bus lane routes still have bus bays. Rebuilding bus stops is expensive but painting lanes red is cheap, so an interim measure to help buses pull out of bays is to make the lane bus-only.The difference between full-day bus lanes and bus-only lanes isn't as big, but I don't see any point in having big signs stating stating full-day hours when you can just say ""buses only"" and call it a day.",Transport,-0.6,0.8,0.7,0.6173,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/15o5i8y/since_this_is_topical_bus_lanes_should_be_247/,Reddit,11/8/2023 10:47

t3_15yxcvr,PAP policies and generational unfairness,"Let's take the new BTO housing model. It's a step in the right direction for the future. But my question is, doesn't it exacerbate inequalities between existing homeowners (whose govt subsidised flats are going to become rare and even more expensive commodities) and future homeowners (whose flats will be under the new scheme)? Why isn't the government doing anything about the existing homeowners who played the system to win a lottery prize? Instead, having acknowledged some of the deep unfairness in the system, the government has decided that only future homeowners will be subject to this new scheme which is meant to mitigate the lottery effect.In my opinion, the PAP's new policies are going to drive an increasingly bigger gulf between the haves and the have nots. The past generations who benefitted the most from the housing policies are going to continue to reap those benefits, at the expense of young people who find that housing have reached unaffordable levels and whose flats may never fetch the same kind of resale value as their seniors' or parents' flats. It's not just the housing policy. Another example that comes to mind is the working mother's child relief. This tax relief was substantially slashed for mothers earning more than 5k a month in Budget 2023 - oh but it only applies to mothers who give birth from 2024 onwards. These mothers are largely going to belong to the younger generation - the ones whose flats will likely be under the new BTO system too. Meanwhile, existing mums who are not planning to have any more kids continue to enjoy exponentially higher tax relief than new mums.So if you're a young person who doesn't have a flat or kids yet, you're really a lot worse off than those who came before you. If you get a Prime or Plus BTO flat, you will face a ton more resale conditions than those who bought their flats under the old schemes. Their flats will continue to appreciate. You will face difficulties selling your flat in the future that they never will. Meanwhile, you or your wife will be paying significantly higher income tax than them, assuming your / her income exceeds 5k a month.In essence, the have nots keep paying a higher and higher price. The haves are blissfully untouched or even benefit from the new policies.

The only reason we have voting is because LKY needed the support of the UK and US and being a ""democracy"" was a requirement for their assistance. We are not a western democracy, not even close. [ when people say, 'Oh, ask the people!' It's childish rubbish. We are leaders. We know the consequences. You mean that ice-water man knows the consequences of his vote? They say people can think for themselves? Do you honestly believe that the chap who can't pass primary six knows the consequences of his choice when he answers a question viscerally on language, culture and religion? Lee Kuan Yew, 1998.\[28\]&#x200B;Lee was an outspoken critic of Western ideals of democracy, stating that ""with a few exceptions, democracy has not brought good government to developing countries.""\[29\] He argued that in states such as China, the concept of democracy was simply ""not workable"", because of the large population size that had to be canvassed, while in India, the results of democracy ""have not been spectacular"".\[9\] He believed in the state interference of the media and personal lives of citizens. He has been criticised for using his political power to wage lawsuits to bankrupt and imprison his political opponents, as in the case of J. B. Jeyaretnam and Chee Soon Juan.\[5\] Francis Seow, the former solicitor-general of Singapore, has described Lee as such:&#x200B;\[T\]he prime minister uses the courts to intimidate, bankrupt, or cripple the political opposition. Distinguishing himself in a caseful of legal suits commenced against dissidents and detractors for alleged defamation, he has won them all.\[30\]",Politics,-0.8,0.95,0.9,0.8369,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/15zzkw3/the_political_philosophy_of_lee_kuan_yew/,Reddit,24/8/2023 11:42

t3_165dgci,Tomorrow is Cooling-off Day. But I cant stop thinking about ECDAs response to the Kinderland case.,"Yes, I know that the President has no policymaking power, and the PAP doesnt want us to conflate the issues at the ballot box. But as much as they want us to compartmentalise away the inconvenient things, as a citizen and parent of a young child I cannot compartmentalise my unease with the general state of affairs. I will admit that it might influence my vote.I consider myself an intelligent and rational voter. I know which issues belong in which bucket and how not to conflate them. I am also not a single-issue voter. But the Kinderland case and ECDAs almost-casual response to has hung over me these couple of days. In short, it makes my blood boil that the abuser was not at least ordered to take a leave of absence during ECDAs investigation.Heres CNAs timeline of events ([ **Aug 10:** ECDA launched its investigation after being alerted to the incidents by ""a former employee"". It did not say who the former employee was.* **Aug 17:** Kinderland said it was made aware of the videos when it was contacted by ECDA on Aug 17. Three staff members of the Woodlands Mart centre met ECDA and were shown the videos.* **Aug 18:** Another Kinderland staff member met ECDA and was shown the videos.* Kinderland headquarters started a disciplinary inquiry and met with Lin. The principal of Woodlands Mart and Lin contacted the parents of the affected children.* **Aug 28:** Videos emerge on social media of the incidents at Woodlands Mart preschool. Lin was arrested and [she was fired]( the above facts, we can safely surmise the following:* ECDA had seen the videos at least as early as 17 Aug, if not 10 Aug. * The preschool teacher was only fired on 28 Aug. Whether it was at ECDAs behest, we do not know. But what we do know is that ECDA has the power to bar a teacher from the preschool sector, which they had done earlier today.* Based on the timeline, no new material evidence had surfaced between 17 Aug and today. Neither does the timeline suggest that ECDA had concluded its investigation by today.* Chronologically, this means that ECDA barred the teacher only after the public uproar emerged. We do not know whether they would have done so anyway. But these are the optics.At the minimum, this means that someone at ECDA had seen the videos on 17 Aug or 10 Aug and still allowed the abuser to continue working as usual for the past 2 weeks or so.It baffles me that the abuser was not put on a leave of absence during the investigation. After all, there is very recent precedence for this at the very top of the government. The following questions have to be asked:* Does ECDA suffer from a worrying lack of urgency or empathy for the plight of small, defenseless kids?* Have our kids, our very own flesh and blood, become mere digits to them?* Do optics weigh more on ECDAs mind than the welfare of toddlers?* Or have abuse cases become so routine that they do not provoke any special urgency?We know the government will do a thorough post-mortem of their response and find a good rationale for every step taken or not taken. The road to the top of a government career is paved with disarming rationalisations. But I am a parent, and you do not get rationalise my children away. And you cannot paper over the trauma that the victims may carry for the rest of their lives.&#x200B;",Public Health,-0.9,0.95,0.9,-0.9897,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/165dgci/tomorrow_is_coolingoff_day_but_i_cant_stop/,Reddit,30/8/2023 12:33

t3_16ng8g5,[Rant] Got Called being a PRC but actually a local when boarding the bus,"I took 165 at Hougang Interchange earlier on and while boarding the bus, someone else and I got called for being PRC because we cut queue(?) and for our apparel for entering bus before these aunties when they are just right ahead of us.Some of you may know this particular railing closest to the road is shorter by half of the actual length (It seems to me that these shorter railings are only at the end of this interchange for no reason) so we can just get out and board the bus instead of going in between the railing which is unnecessarily painful especially people here usually carry groceries bags.So there are roughly only 6 people ahead of me and someone and the queue will cut off then people would make a new line to enter the right side of the entrance while the first 6 people would enter the left side of the entrance. And throughout 25 years of my life, it has been a common practice for people who frequent this bus because it makes perfectly sense. Just one day today, the first man had some issues with his card and jammed up the 5 people behind him on the left, while someone else and I are the first two are entering the right side with ease and so is the people following us at the back.Then I overheard ~50-60 y/o auntie calling us ""Huh aren't they behind us, why suddenly in-front of us? They wear hat confirm from China"" in Hokkien when they were sitting (I guess we may have taken his favourite seat). Coincidentally, the person in front of me and I were wearing a hat so I knew they were talking about us.I didn't confront because it was a small matter and no point changing the mindsets of old people. BUT IT SEEMS SO UNFAIR TO CHINESE PEOPLE? and it creates negative connotations for no reason and it spreads. I have friends from China and they behave way better than me and some singaporeans I know.This makes me lament about older people for being so stingy and inpatient and its not like our actions have resulted them not having a space to sit.PS I wont be asking if what we did is not appropriate because it has been the standard practice for this particular bus for years and we queued up so no wrongdoings here.",Transport,-0.7,0.85,0.6,-0.9574,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/16ng8g5/rant_got_called_being_a_prc_but_actually_a_local/,Reddit,20/9/2023 8:50

I know childcare only have this requirement for teachers teaching K1 & K2 but not for classes of the younger children.Recently, while walking pass a group of 3-4 years old toddlers with their ""teacher"" at the void deck, I heard the ""teacher"" telling the group of toddlers to ""Put your friend's hand down.""

It took me a moment to realise what she actually meant was she wanted to show them how to skip or what is skipping.Toddlers learn very fast from what they see and what they hear at this stage and I am very concern that they are exposed to such atrocious language 9-12 hours a day from ""teachers"" who themselves might not even get a pass (C6) in O level English. If we do not even have teacher of such standard in Primary School, then why are we allowing ""teachers"" of such standard to teach in Childcare?

t3_170odnx,Universal Baby Income - Thoughts?,"Any thoughts on a **Universal Baby Income**?According to SingStat, Singapore's fertility rate as of 2022 is 1.04, far below the fertility rate of 2.1 necessary to maintain a nation's population. In 2020, Singapore's fertility rate was 1.1, so generally, it's uncontroversial that the fertility rate has been trending downwards. I was amused by a recent article claiming that 'Singapore can't just throw money at this problem to solve it', and well, I am wondering if Singapore can't in fact do precisely that - throw money at this problem to solve it.One of the most commonly cited reasons for not having a child is due to the high cost of living, especially when one has to deal with the added expenses relating to having a child. From baby formulas to supplementary classes to tuitions and beyond, the cost of having a child in Singapore largely discourages people from having one.Why not consider a Universal Baby Income? Simply, if you have a child, you are eligible to receive $1,000 a month in cash until your child reaches the age of 18. This is capped at three children, so you won't receive more beyond the third child. At least one parent and the child must be Singaporean. The cost is not small, but it's also not impossible. SingStat does not reveal the number of Singaporeans below 18, but does state that the number of residents in Singapore below 20 to be 791,300. Assuming that about 80% of these are Singaporeans below 18, a plausible estimate is that there are around 632,040 Singaporeans below 18. A Universal Baby Income would therefore cost around $632 million a month, or **$7.5 billion a year**. To put it into context, for FY 2023, total expenditure across the various ministries is expected to rise to $77.7 billion, so this would be approximately a 10% increase in Singapore's governmental expenditures. Another way of contextualizing this is that during the Covid-19 crisis, Singapore spent $72.3 billion to fight Covid-19. This would have funded the proposed universal baby income for around 9 years. When there is a crisis, when there is a need, Singapore can find the money.I am aware that there are already tax credit schemes and other schemes to support families with children. However, I doubt that most Singaporeans can articulate or are even aware of any of their details. The ignorance and uncertainty, in my view, largely militates against their efficacy; simply, they do little to assuage fears that having a child would be unaffordable. On the flipside, a universal baby income is simple to grasp and the benefits are clear.I envisage that such a scheme would have to have be reviewed every ten years to consider whether an upwards adjustment is necessary and affordable to consider inflation. I also note that, as far as I know, the general corpus of economic and academic studies indicate that a universal basic income would not by itself have a strong inflationary pressure. In any case, I wonder if the cons of any such inflationary pressure would be outweighed by the economic and social benefits of having a sustainable population, and could also reduce the reliance on foreign immigration.For the avoidance of doubt: no, I personally do not have a kid, nor am I married with the expectation of having one anytime soon.",Economy,-0.4,0.85,0.7,-0.9745,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/170odnx/universal_baby_income_thoughts/,Reddit,5/10/2023 17:48
t3_1713n5j,The approach to new MRT openings is getting outdated,"One thing I've noticed with the PR effort, and likely by extension, the policy thinking, around new MRT lines opening is that they seem to be targeted at car owners and people who would drive. Have you seen the posters? ""Give your car a break - take TEL3"".Has it worked? Nope. For every dollar the LTA spends on TEL operations, it makes less than 6 cents. If you count only the service fees paid to SMRT, it's better, but only 11.6 cents. SBST management has also [gone on the record]( that their break-even point for DTL is 650k - far higher than the LTA's ridership estimates of 500k. That it still produces losses in the rail side, despite operating the cash-cow NEL, points to a policy failure.The high use of public transport in Singapore and the recent astronomical COE prices makes it very difficult to get more people to give up their cars. Just look at all the new parents who insist they need a car to bring the little ones out on the weekends.Consequently, if there is diminishing returns from converting car owners, the LTA should shift their focus to primarily targeting public transport users.It controls more of this experience; as central bus planner under bus contracting, it should be the LTA's job to redesign local bus networks to drive more inter-regional trips to the MRT system. Furthermore, since new lines like TEL and CRL are being built to relieve overpressure sections of the existing MRT network, MRT passengers also need a push factor to take the new lines. TEL waiting times may be that long because there's not enough passengers to use it - so if you want shorter waiting times, you should support steps taken to increase ridership.Firstly, long milk-run routes (like 51, 61, 961) are less reliable, and since waiting time is a KPI, bus operators are forced to increase travel times along these routes (which means added cost) in order to provide space to cushion the impact of traffic and meet their waiting time KPIs. We've all seen and complained about bus bunching. Breaking these long routes to reduce bus travel time should happen.Secondly, in the north and soon east, reconsider the regional relevance of the City Direct system and other similar services (850E, 951E, 982E, etc), travelling on expressways to the CBD during peak periods. Peak-period expressway congestion results in longer travel time compared to the off-peak ideal, which means bus companies, again, have to devote more resources to ensure a consistent waiting time and punctual departures. By shifting these to the MRT system, bus resources can be conserved to improve intratown and short-distance travel.Thirdly, there must be consideration on beefing up local services to better connect people to new lines. It took five years to provide a DTL connection to residents of Bedok North Ave 4 with the amendment of Service 18 only done in 2022. This ignorance of MRT connections still exists, with the new [Service 163B]( literally ending one stop short of Lentor MRT. This means that there is no additional capacity, or reason, for Sengkang residents to use the TEL to avoid the NEL.Fourthly, travel times. Traffic congestion is not caused only by cars, it can be caused by buses too. Both have to be counted, and not just during the off-peak ideal. Bus-only systems in other cities also suffer from the same problems, and that's why Ong Teng Cheong pushed to have the MRT built. There is space to optimize the MRT service and it should be taken. Similarly, a more compact bus network can provide shorter intervals between buses using the same manpower resources. Bus passengers who don't touch the MRT, such as seniors and students travelling within a HDB town, can also benefit from this. Lastly, all of us must also realize that there are other factors such as reliability and punctuality, which the MRT can do better; and as Singapore's workforce shrinks and labor costs increase, automated MRT lines are the solution to managing these costs. In contrast, new bus depots under construction even contain foreign worker dorms, indicating that the LTA foresees we will still need to import foreign bus drivers en masse.The ~150 buses or so in storage pale in comparison to the billions of dollars spent on MRT lines that so far remain underused. The DTL costs $20 billion, the TEL $25 billion, and that's before operating subsidies paid out to keep the lines afloat. We are opening new MRT lines every year until 2032, and if they don't learn this lesson now, they may be bleeding out on the CRL; with CRL designed more for relieving the existing network than providing new access.Ottawa even had to break their bus-only system, replacing it with a train. A majority of bus services were cut back to the train terminals instead of going to downtown Ottawa, and they're a much smaller city than us. Planned extensions to the Ottawa O-Train also include pushing the bus terminals further back into line extensions, to split them up and prevent them from congesting a given terminal.Opening a new rail line every year literally means we need to do something like this every year, but that is not happening. The expectation of ""build it and the car drivers will come"", which served us well during the NSEWL and perhaps NEL years, is no longer relevant - all the more so when bus companies were able to see the impact of the coming MRT then and adapt their networks accordingly.Now you wonder why transport ministers keep talking about sustainability, but so far it seems to be all talk and no action. If MOT wants to cut public transport costs, this is where it should start, by recognizing the impact of the MRT early and taking proactive steps to manage it. There's probably more than 10 years worth of adaptation to be made.",Transport,-0.8,0.95,0.9,0.9862,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1713n5j/the_approach_to_new_mrt_openings_is_getting/,Reddit,6/10/2023 4:57

t3_1790r2v,A personal crocodile story,"> I've posted the same story to other platforms under my own name, so this might be self-doxxing. But honestly, people need to know the actual risks when we make nice motherhood statements about encouraging coexistence with large apex predators like crocodiles. Coexistence is possible. But at the same time, it will involve an incredible amount of hard work and resources on everyone's part, strict adherence to guidelines, and the acceptance that despite all your preparations and safeguards, someday, somebody might still get munched on. And whether it was the person's fault or not, it's the entire crocodile population that will bear the brunt of public anger.I'd like to share something personal. Recent events have brought back a repressed memory, one that I've kind of downplayed in the past, buried in my mind, and never really shared widely, even with my peers in Singapore's nature community.This is going to be a long story, so buckle up.Several years back, through my own actions, I could have been eaten by a crocodile.Those of you who have known me IRL for several years know that I used to work for NParks. Make of that what you will.I was based at Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve, and while the main focus of my work involved fieldwork outside of the reserve, on days when we were around in the office, my project teammates and I were still actively involved in some of the day to day operations within Sungei Buloh. This included providing extra manpower for outreach activities and events on weekends, meeting VIPs and showing them around, staying overnight to ring shorebirds, an assortment of wildlife surveys, planting mangrove saplings, camera trapping, assisting with patrols, attending to visitors, and more. Fun times.Sometimes we had to respond to wildlife encounters. For example, there were times when we had to move Shore Pit Vipers slightly further away from the trails and boardwalks, in case somebody unknowingly got too close. Or the small troop of Long-tailed Macaques would be up to some mischief and we would have to get visitors to behave themselves around the monkeys.Crocodiles were part and parcel of a typical workday at Sungei Buloh. Like other potentially dangerous wildlife like venomous snakes and hornets, they were simply a part of the environment, but the possible consequences of a close encounter with a crocodile meant we were always on the lookout for crocodiles, especially if we were doing any sort of work close to the waters edge. During shorebird ringing sessions, someone always had to be on the lookout for crocodiles lurking nearby, especially since the bulk of our activity took place at night.For the most part, the crocodiles avoided people. Sure, we had large individuals like Tailless and Alpha, but we kept away from them, and they kept away from us. Once in a while though, a large crocodile would crawl out of the water onto the trail to bask (this was before the barriers were installed along the trails), blocking the path.While dealing with the crocodiles themselves was straightforward, there was significant public concern, especially when reports of these incidents made their way to social media. Every time this happened, youd get people saying that the crocodiles should all be culled, grumbling that the authorities would only take action after somebody was killed, and so on. You know, the typical angry people online, who would often resort to hyperbole and misinformation.Most of these comments could be dismissed and disregarded. After all, the risks were relatively low, as long as people behaved themselves and did not do stupid things.It wasn't long before I had a close encounter with a crocodile at Sungei Buloh, although I was never in any real danger.One night, I was trying to catch and remove several non-native Gnther's Frogs from the small, relatively shallow pond at the Wetland Centre, close to the former Main Bridge. As I started to wade into the pond, a large reptile burst out of the water, dashed out of the pond away from me, ran a short distance through the undergrowth, and plunged into the river that was just a short distance away.I was very surprised by this sudden encounter, and I froze for a few moments. From the brief glimpse I had in the light cast by my headlamp, it definitely wasnt a Malayan Water Monitor.I walked towards where the animal had fled, stood on the top of the riverbank, and looked down: there, a few metres downslope, glaring at me from the river, was a juvenile crocodile, about 1 to 1.5 metres or so in length. So while I was certainly startled, it wasn't actually a dangerous interaction.This incident, and several other encounters with smaller 1-2 metre long crocodiles, where they always fled from us, made me become a little complacent. After some time, I got a bit blas about crocodiles; sure, they were potentially dangerous, but as long as I was always on the lookout, avoided the larger ones, and didnt take stupid risks, Id be fine.One day, sometime in 2015, I ended up taking a really stupid risk. I cannot remember the exact date anymore, but I recall the events as they unfolded.I was alone, in a staff area next to the Wetland Centre, where the boat we use for patrols and offshore surveys is parked when not in use. I had some very muddy containers to clean and rinse out, and while I could have opted to rinse them out with a hose, I foolishly decided to stand on the boat ramp and wash them in the river. After all, the mud came from the river, might as well return the mud to the river. The tide was high; oh good, I thought to myself at that time, I dont have to walk too far out on the slippery boat ramp and risk getting my feet muddy while I wash things.I approached the waters edge, and took a quick glance around. All clear: no sign of any crocodiles in the vicinity. I squatted down, and started washing my containers. At short intervals, I would pause, look up, and scan the area for crocodiles, before resuming. Still no sign of them. I continued my washing.But remember:I was alone.It was high tide.I was squatting down, right at the waters edge.When you read about crocodile attacks, many of the victims were grabbed under similar circumstances, when they least expected it.As I continued washing, I must have gotten distracted, and stopped looking up for some time. Because when I finally looked up, what I saw made me suddenly realise the terrible decision I had made, and just how vulnerable I truly was.A large adult crocodile, some 2 to 3 metres in length, was slowly cruising past me, several metres away. It wasnt approaching me, just heading upstream. Im terrible at gauging distances, so I dont know how far away it was. It could have been as little as 5 metres away, it could have been 10 metres, maybe a little more. Whatever the case, the moment I saw it, I immediately grabbed my containers and backed away from the water. The crocodile simply continued floating upriver, and swam out of sight.But as I left the area, I realised one chilling fact: the moment I spotted the crocodile, it was already passing my position along the riverbank. Which means that I had been extremely careless, had kept my head down for way too long, and had failed to notice the crocodile while it was downstream and swimming closer.Immediately after that incident, I mentioned it in passing to some of my ex-colleagues, and must have downplayed it, because at that time, I didnt feel like I was in any real danger.When your average work day can include an insane plethora of unpredictable potential hazards, ranging from hornet nests, lightning strikes, shards of broken glass and rusty metal hidden in the undergrowth, and falling trees, to venomous snakes, getting stabbed in the face by an angry heron, heatstroke, getting stuck in soft mud, drowning, or simply getting lost in the forest, a near miss like that becomes just another story you laugh about at the end of another work day. Besides, the crocodile was only swimming past, it's not like it lunged at me and I had to perform a split-second dodge.But the more I thought about it, the more I realised just how close I came to possibly dying that day.In this case, the crocodile was simply passing by, and did not take any interest in me. But what if it had been hungry? What if it had seen me, squatting down by the waters edge, distracted, and decided to take a chance? What if the splashing and sounds made by me washing the containers had sounded like a thrashing fish, and drew its attention? Given the really small distance between us, it could have simply changed direction, silently submerged, and approached for an ambush. And I would have been none the wiser.Im sharing this story not to make myself seem brave for surviving a potentially dangerous situation with a wild crocodile.I was not brave. I was incredibly stupid, I was careless, I took an unbelievably unnecessary risk, and under different circumstances, I could have very well been the first documented crocodile bite victim in Singapore in the 21st century.But I dare say that among all the people in Singapore who have been thinking and talking a lot about crocodiles over the past week, probably very few people can say they've had a similar experience like mine. The moral of the story here is that even among people who spend time around crocodiles on a regular basis, it's so easy to let your guard down and become complacent. But one momentary lapse in judgment can easily mean disaster.You think youre careful and cautious enough. It wont happen to me, what are the odds?The gods of the river, mangrove and coast see you, and simply watch, and wait. You take your eyes off the water, and if an opportunity presents itself, you are entirely at their mercy.Theyre experts in watching and waiting; the lineage that gave rise to our modern-day crocodilians has been doing the same thing for tens of millions of years, watching and waiting, masters of the aquatic ambush.Their ancestors shared the world with the non-avian dinosaurs, during the Late Cretaceous period. When a giant rock fell out of the sky 66 million years ago, set the world on fire, then plunged the planet into the equivalent of nuclear winter, wiping out most of their archosaurian kin, the crocodilians simply retreated to the water and hunkered down.Before long, they were able to resume watching and waiting, this time in a world that would eventually be dominated by mammals.The crocodilians have honed their predatory skills on prey that is far quicker, far more agile, and far warier than us.If youre ever close to the water in crocodile country, never, ever assume that its completely safe.So many of my ex-colleagues at Sungei Buloh have their own close encounters and other crocodile stories. Some of them had to trap and move crocodiles away from the ponds in the reserve where the risk of an attack on a human is simply too high. My ex-colleagues were also involved in the capture and relocation of the 1.7 metre crocodile at Lower Seletar Reservoir in 2019.Staff in Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve and others in NParks have been consulting with crocodile experts in Australia's Northern Territory, where so much work has been done to mitigate human-crocodile conflict, learning from the best in the field. And yes, despite having so much more tolerance and trying so hard to encourage coexistence, removal of crocodiles in some areas for human safety is standard procedure all over the Northern Territory and Queensland.So implying that NParks doesn't know what it's doing is honestly rather ignorant.I also need to stress that this is why it's so important that visitors stay on the trails in Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve at all times.The staff sometimes have to perform work closer to the water's edge, but they are aware of the risks and take all sorts of precautions. Even though the crocodiles behave themselves for the most part, among all the visitors to Sungei Buloh, sadly there will always be a small proportion of people who will readily put their own lives and the animals' lives in jeopardy.People may complain about the decision to install the wooden barriers along the public trails throughout so much of the reserve, but with the large crocodiles coming up to bask on the trails and people doing idiotic things like approaching the crocodiles or taking selfies with the crocodiles, it was only a matter of time before a crocodile lunged at someone.Now, with the barriers in place, the risk is significantly reduced. The wooden barriers exclude the larger crocodiles, while juveniles, along with all the other smaller creatures, such as monitor lizards, snakes, and otters, can still pass freely through the gaps.The large crocodiles can still move between the rivers and tidal ponds via the sluice gates. As long as visitors keep to the trails, and never cross the barriers, the crocodiles are protected from human stupidity.In the core area of Sungei Buloh (Route 2 and Route 3, for those of you who remember), there are no barriers, so the crocodiles are still free to bask on the trails and travel overland if they want to. This is also why it's important that visitors do not enter areas that are out of bounds to the public. There used to be so many issues with people trespassing into areas of the reserve not open to the public, until actual gates had to be installed.In the past, we've had a camera trap showing a family with young children trespassing and walking down a closed trail, with the next sequence of photos then showing a crocodile hauled up onto the very same spot not long after the family had passed.If you love crocodiles, and are excited about the prospects of being able to see them in Sungei Buloh, please don't do stupid shit. NParks has done so much to make things safer for ordinary visitors, but if you approach the water, cross the barriers, or enter areas that are closed to the public, your safety is not guaranteed.If someone gets hurt through their own actions, we can easily say, ""Oh they deserved it,"" but it's still a human life that's been dramatically affected.And regardless of who was at fault, any incident involving someone getting hurt by a crocodile will simply make the general public even less keen on the idea of having wild crocodiles living and breeding freely in Singapore.We already have so many people who are afraid of stepping foot in Sungei Buloh, despite the barriers and other safety measures. Sure, we don't need to pander to them, but the fact is that we cannot control how people feel.What we can do is to manage the risks realistically so that such paranoia and fear don't come to dominate the discourse.I still love crocodiles so much. I have so much admiration for their raw power, their amazing hunting prowess, their intelligence, their complex and rich social lives, their gentler, nurturing side, their resilience and ability to just keep surviving, despite the challenges they face at times.But ever since that incident, Ive gained an even healthier respect for them. And this is why I strongly emphasise that we must never ever underestimate the potential dangers that can arise when crocodiles and humans come into close contact.Especially when were talking about human communities who are naive about crocodiles and what theyre truly capable of.I was aware of the possible dangers, and yet I took an unnecessary risk, and could have paid the price. And if we do not take things seriously, someday, somebody might unknowingly take that risk, with a possibly very tragic outcome.Learning to live with apex predators is complicated in so many ways; I am always reading about how communities all over the world are grappling with the idea of living alongside crocodilians, big cats, wolves, and bears, and there are so many stories and lessons about what's worked and what hasn't worked elsewhere.In the near future, I'll share some of my thoughts on trying to coexist with crocodiles in Singapore, and the critical work that needs to be done if we are to prepare Singaporeans for coexistence with crocodiles outside of our northwestern coastline.So this is my story, the invaluable lesson that one of the Sungei Buloh crocodiles taught me, and one of the reasons why I did not share in the seemingly unanimous outrage over the culling of the crocodile at Marina East.You think you really know crocodiles and the Singapore public is truly ready to give coexistence a try? Think again. You are not prepared.But hey, what do I know? According to some people, I'm just a smart alec trying to make excuses on behalf of NParks. All I can say in response to such accusations is this, and no pun intended, BITE ME.",Public Safety,-0.6,0.85,0.9,0.9681,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1790r2v/a_personal_crocodile_story/,Reddit,16/10/2023 7:57

Sharing two encounters:First encounter in a food court - cleaner got mad at me despite putting the tray at the tray collection point after I placed the tray there and told me I cant put it there even though Im 100% sure that is the tray return area. I just walked away quietly in shock as he shouted at me for putting it there. Second encounter at hawker centre - the cleaner staff was visibly seen sipping her drink and watching a video at the tray return point, when I put the tray there, the cleaner told me that she have leg pain and point to me at the dishes cleaning area. I just left the tray at the designated tray return area where there are a few other trays placed on other racks.I was completely surprised and shocked at those two incidents, why do we need more than one designated tray collection point then? Might as well just only put a single tray return area and tell everyone to put the tray there so the cleaner staff dont need to walk a distance just to keep trays.I already did my part to return my tray and my plate/bowl/cutlery, why do I now have to walk a further distance to return my tray despite it being completely acceptable to just place it at the designed tray return area?I understand that at times, staff are exhausted from the long hours of work, but what I did was completely within the guidelines of the tray return framework. I dont mind to go a bit further if the tray return area is full but what I dont like is the staffs attitude telling me to do something because they want to save an additional trip of walking which made me leave the tray at the designed return area.",Public Health,-0.6,0.8,0.6,0.5431,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/17gvlqn/why_cant_i_return_my_traydishes_to_the_tray/,Reddit,26/10/2023 12:40

t3_17hmr5u,War in the South China Sea: Chinese First Strike on Singapore,"We all know that our geographical neighbourhood is getting spicer. China is threatening to invade Taiwan, whilst claiming most of the South China Sea, and the US is trying to stop them. War in the South China Sea is becoming more likely so what does that mean for us? Before watching this [video]( I always assumed wed [stay neutral in a war to avoid the wrath of China and to make the US happy.]( At most, wed help the US supply their ships and thats it, the SAF isnt going to do anything. Meanwhile our economy is going to suffer through having a warzone so close to us. But this video pointed out something I never thought of, what if China attacks us anyway? Note: I know Real Life Lore isnt a 100% accurate and trustable channel, but I feel that he makes a good point in this video.So the gist is that the [US Navy is going to use Changi Naval Base not just to supply their ships, but to blockade the Straits of Singapore to prevent ships from heading to China. This will eliminate a large portion of Chinas oil supply and trade.]( I always knew the US Navy would do that in a war, [but I never thought about what China was going to do about it.]( China decides to Pearl Harbour their way into war like in the video, their ballistic missiles are going to land here. Definitely at Changi Naval Base and maybe at [Paya Lebar Airbase]( and [Sembawang Shipyards]( Our Air Forces radar (either the [Aerostat]( or the Aster 30 SAMP/Ts radar) might be able to detect the incoming ballistic missiles. To shoot them down, we have our [Aster 30 SAMP/T]( and our [Formidable Class Frigates]( (equipped with the Aster 30 missile).As of the writing of this, the longest-range ballistic missiles that the Aster 30 can effectively shoot down are Medium-range ballistic missiles (1,000 - 3,000 km range). However, China would most likely use Intermediate-range ballistic missiles (3,0005,500 km range), [which the Aster 30 cant effectively shoot down just yet.]( (Note, I am not an expert so this part might be wrong) Assuming the Aster 30 Block 2 BMD isnt available yet prior to war breaking out, some ballistic missiles are going to be shot down, but some are going to get through and land. Even if theyre available in time, China might be able to oversaturate our missile defences through volume. Moored ships are sunk, piers are wrecked, runways are cratered and buildings (especially command and control) are destroyed. So what happens next? Well, our government would probably dump neutrality and side with the US over this attack. Our economy would go to shit as trade stops flowing and markets panic. After that things become hard to predict and basically become military fan fiction. [Some believe war with China will break out by 2025/2026/2027.]( For all our sakes, lets hope theyre wrong.

t3_17qk2n0,In response to a recent r/singapore post on how to increase ridership for new rail lines...,"A while back on the more public transport-related side of r/singapore there has been one post in particular generating quite some buzz due to its highly controversial message. Unfortunately it came at a time when I was particularly committed elsewhere, hence this very late posting (the original post was published on 6th October 2023).[Link to original post here.]( it contains much dangerous confusion in public transport discourse locally which we should be aware of and steer clear from. I am in no way implying the author (or OP as I will refer to) is out with any malicious agenda, but it is good to be aware of unhelpful thinking that doesn't improve public transport, and avoid it actively.To tl;dr the long 990-word essay that OP has typed up, he wonders why the TEL (and DTL), despite operating in revenue service its third stage already and currently serving the CBD, is still not ""performing as well"" as expected. There is no doubt that the TEL in its current form ""sucks"" compared to the other lines -- commuters know how to vote with their feet. To examine this phenomenon of subpar ridership statistics on rail lines, OP goes down a long and complex rabbit hole to (try to) explain why it's the case and suggest possible remedies. Unfortunately, this complex line of reasoning is riddled with fatally inaccurate assumptions, shaky logic, and prioritising the wrong things, which was why the long scholarly-appearing piece came off as offensive to many common folk who actually experience the system on a daily basis, and more critically ***rely*** on it in their lives.The entire issue of underperforming rail lines, while a factual reality, has been framed entirely wrongly by OP, from the very start of the piece.>Has it worked? Nope. For every dollar the LTA spends on TEL operations, it makes less than 6 cents. If you count only the service fees paid to SMRT, it's better, but only 11.6 cents.Once issues concerning public transport (planning, operations, or management) are framed from the angle of revenue (or worse, ***profits***), the point of the discussion is lost, and further reasoning along this line of thought only digs a deeper grave for the OP. Public transport **cannot** be run like any normal business would -- outside dystopian levels of urban density the free market would simply not produce public transport service that would be of acceptable quality and quantity to us. To frame public transport issues predominantly as one of dollars and cents (as was described by one commenter on OP's post) misses the point, as well as the far more nuanced role that public transport plays in Singapore's society beyond just generating revenue for the government. To start off the post by quoting the TEL's farebox recovery rate **assumes** that public transport (*as a whole*) should be profitable on its own, when more often than not, the greater social goals of a connective transit system with abundant quality service often means otherwise. As commenters in the original post have rightfully called out the OP over, metrices of ""sustainability"" for a public transport system cannot be limited to just cost and revenue! Do you measure the benefits of healthcare and education in just dollars and cents? Yes, but such finance-based assessments in the real world examine the **aggregate** economic impact on the entire economy, rather than immediate costs and profits!First up, the OP needs to be realistic, especially when considering the situation of newer rail lines here. Unlike the older 6-car lines which almost entirely pass through dense HDB estates for a large majority of the route, the DTL and especially TEL do not nearly serve as much density. There is only so much you can do with hub-and-spoking the entire system around that single line serving lower density before the network structure gets very out of proportion, as the OP himself will demonstrate to great irony later. A chicken-and-egg relationship exists between service and ridership, but OP gets it just wrong. What is necessary to convince commuters to do a mode switch to ride trains? **Service.** You can build it, but if service fails to meet the mark (and being in Singapore, commuters have very high expectations for transit service), forget about getting riders on trains. If we wait until the TEL is completely full before improving service, OP basically says ""how about never"", given that the density along TEL makes it unrealistic to expect crush loading that necessitates better service. On the other hand, proactively improving TEL service would better convince existing bus riders, and motorists to switch. Mind you, the TEL is competing against highly robust bus services operating well enough during the peak to convince passengers to stay despite the opening of Stage 3 over a year ago.OP proposes that the recently-introduced Service 163B be extended to become a feeder for Lentor station on the TEL, in supposedly an effort to relieve the[ overcongested NEL]( by *diverting passengers from Sengkang to ride the TEL from Lentor*. Now, if the OP has actually pulled out an actual map, or even consulted (!!) Google Maps, it should be obvious that no rational commuter in their right mind would actually pick such a route over one that already exists for them in the north-east! Towards the city, queuing in line for a jam-packed NEL train is still twice as fast as detouring all the way to Lentor and boarding the TEL. Those heading north already have 161 and 965, which could be improved further but otherwise are robust options! For the same journey, one travels further and incurs additional time penalty. Who would willingly switch, unless forced to? Maybe if their destination was directly along TEL2, but for most cases 163 already provides a direct trip anyway.In a similar vein, the point of amending bus routes (at least, not until rationalisation became the key motivation for such) is to create a more interconnective overall network that incorporates, and acknowledges the ability of both modes to create a system that, to the best of its ability with resources available, provides fast, convenient and connective journeys for all. To make it clear, nowhere in the previous sentence implied ""forcing commuters to choose the train when a bus does the job equally well"", unlike what OP is implying with the example of Service 18's amendment to serve Tampines East station. Nothing's wrong with it, until its intent gets twisted out of context. In any case, numerous train disruptions over the past decade demonstrate that forcing people on trains is a foolhardy idea, despite the presence of additional parallel rail lines in recent years. Look no further than the NSL and TEL's interconnected breakdown streak this year.OP claims that ""long milk-run routes"" are *less reliable*, as if there was a correlation between bus route length and reliability, when truth to be told, there is none. Feeder services can throw you ridiculous bunching and clumping nonsense too when demand surges during the peak periods, as any resident in towns with ""dual-loop"" feeder services can attest.That aside, OP makes a truckload of confused and incorrect assumptions about buses and what they can (or can't) do, almost all of which are unfounded by a bit more international awareness. Unfortunately, these tropes also commonly heard elsewhere, so it's worthy examining them here.Perhaps the most fatal of them all that guides the bulk of the post was the notion that buses are *inherently* unreliable or inefficient, for no reason other than them being buses. It shouldn't be hard to see why this is patently false -- even our LTA's own efforts, however half-baked, shatter such simplistic caricatures of what buses should be like. Continuing the train of thought from above, OP claims *""bus operators are forced to increase travel times along these \[long trunk\] routes (which means added cost) in order to provide space to cushion the impact of traffic and meet their waiting time KPIs""*. While subtle, it is an insinuation that buses inherently get stuck in traffic, and hence are definitely less reliable. This is also OP's favourite attack against buses in general if one reads his other works elsewhere on the internet -- ""buses get stuck in traffic, hence are less reliable and ***must be replaced by trains!!***"". Uh, nope. Heard of something called a ***bus-only lane***? I know Singapore doesn't have much of those (Bencoolen Street being the only working demonstration of this), but is this not a call to instead strengthen bus priority, rather than calling for their outright demise straight away...? Initiatives such as signal priority (the real one where the buses actually rig the signals) and dedicated bus lanes from around the world easily disprove OP's argument. Arguing in a similar vein that congestion forces bus operators to have to dedicate more disproportionately more resources towards trunk operations is also unfounded. Refusing to improve bus priority beyond current efforts afforded by LTA is an ***institutional*** issue arising from underprioritisation, not an ***intrinsic*** issue to buses as a transport mode themselves.Besides being stuck in the old mentality about buses, much confused talk from the OP shows he doesn't have any idea what he's going on about.May I present this big brain statement from OP:>Traffic congestion is not caused only by cars, it can be caused by buses too. Both have to be counted, and not just during the off-peak ideal*How much do you hate buses, so much so that you think traffic congestion is caused by them???* Whether out of intellectual dishonesty, OP is missing the forest for the trees here. I seriously wonder if he actually thinks peak hour traffic congestion primarily consists for buses, from the way this argument was framed. Also... *is it not during the peak period, where bus priority initiatives are at their most effective????* Recap: bus priority initiatives are oriented toward giving buses an advantage over cars in situations where the latter would be stuck, such as general congestion, or traffic junctions. What is the OP getting at here?In further confused talk, OP pits trains vs. buses in reliability to prove the superiority of the former. The big elephant in the room being missed here is that when talking about something as interconnected as public transport, reliability must be seen from a **system-wide** level, rather than on an individual line or mode level as OP implies. Having a part of the network being less reliable than the other due to institutional inertia does not help the reliability and resilience of the overall network, and results in worse outcomes for all, which runs counter to the spirit of building up the network in the first place.The fallacy of rail being inherently opposed to buses due to the mode type runs prevalent in the post, with OP claiming again, that because buses are buses and trains are trains, the latter can be automated while the former cannot, thus making trains even ""better"". Such a statement cannot belie OP's ignorance of bus automation projects around the world that have been ongoing for at least a decade, with the[ most recent demonstration in Scotland and Dubai]( featuring the equivalent of a full-sized single-decker bus here, running autonomously with the crew only monitoring operations. With Singapore still choosing to put hostlers on ***every*** train on the automatic (GoA4) lines, the point on manpower savings is only as effective as the improved staff to passenger ratio a train gets compared to the buses it replaces, and when automation is so prevalent in future that no staff are needed on board throughout, OP's point is but moot.In his quest to argue for rail to replace buses as far as possible, OP demonstrates his lack of understanding of how buses work here, and how they're used. Ironically, his suggestion to break up long trunk routes into smaller segments goes against his own mantra of a hyper-efficient transport system, as two shorter routes will require marginally more resources to operate. Each end of a bus route typically requires 1 extra bus parked, for layover purposes, so breaking a long route in two means adding an extra set of buses laying over at two extra ends. There's also the issue of the city area having insufficient bus infrastructure to actually handle that many routes being split up into two, for the matter.OP then claims that ""shifting long-haul trips to the MRT"" would enable bus resources to be ""conserved"" for shorter trips. To translate the lingo into simple terms, OP advocates for a hub-and-spoke style public transport system, which has been demonstrated to be wildly inefficient in serving large areas with fewer resources, as the experiences of Woodlands and Yishun since the 1990s have shown. That aside, OP will do well to actually check ridership statistics of feeder services compared to those of trunk and long feeder routes, because if longer trips by bus constitute the bulk of all bus rides, then forcing them onto the rail network will not end well, especially with a rail line plagued by disruptions, already overcrowded rail lines, and rail lines built severely under capacity. Hell, I'll be generous and be willing to concede on this point if combined ridership of feeder and long-feeder routes exceed trunk service ridership!Let's look at some more word salad:>Similarly, a more compact bus network can provide shorter intervals between buses using the same manpower resources. Bus passengers who don't touch the MRT, such as seniors and students travelling within a HDB town, can also benefit from this.Based on what OP describes, the ""compact bus network"" in question is a hub-and-spoke one, almost entirely consisting of only feeder buses. Of course, if you deleted every trunk bus route off the map today, we'd suddenly find ourselves with an immense surplus of buses and manpower, and it would be even possible to make every feeder run at two-minute intervals! Yet despite such, ""bus passengers who don't touch the MRT"" would not benefit, simply because they no longer exist! In a hub-and-spoke transport system, there would be highly limited scope of public transport trips that would not involve going beyond each town, thus making the benefactors in this argument a very niche group that hardly travels beyond town boundaries...Picking the right arguments to make your stand is one matter (which OP fails at), and finding the appropriate examples to back up your claims is yet another. The international example chosen to support intensive bus cuts (Ottawa) is one of the worst possible, even within Canada. OP cites how Ottawa ""broke their bus-only system"" to accommodate the opening of their O-train light rail system, specifically how bus routes previously plying into the city were ""forced back to terminate at O-train stations"" to prevent ""congesting"" downtown terminals. Canadian readers looking at OP's post are dying from second-hand cringe, knowing full-well how[ the terrible implementation of the O-train]( has resulted in worse ridership for public transport overall.[ While many Canadian cities saw transit ridership generally increase, Ottawa has been struggling to achieve this trend]( A more instructive vignette is to look at how it fares compared to Vancouver, which has only 60% the population. More importantly, their TransLink doesn't engage in the same drastic scaling down of bus services to favour rail service. Yet, Vancouver has three times as many riders on transit than Ottawa. OP probably hasn't realised that Ottawa's dismal ridership figures are a red flag that he isn't quoting an appropriate counter-example. This comparison is a demonstration that what really matters in getting people on public transport is ***not*** mode, but rather the quality of service. Ironically, this answers the initial question that guided OP's entire post -- ""how to get more people to ride new MRT lines?"" Well, improving TEL services proactively is a good start.OP further notes that Ottawa is a small city compared to Singapore, and thus if a smaller city gutters its bus network, we should as well right? To break his bubble, us being a larger city instead means that we have ***redundancy requirements*** that a smaller city would not necessarily need. And even so, given the amount of trouble Ottawa has encountered with their light rail system, they will do well to have it too.It's about public transport versus cars, as OP likes to say both on Reddit and elsewhere. He claims that since our public transport usage rate and COE prices are sky-high, it's difficult to convince motorists to switch. Newsflash: decimating the public transport network by converting it to hub-and-spoke and making trips by public transport more of a hassle is only making more people switch to driving instead, and of course, if they're getting that COE at all cost, it won't be given up so easily ***unless service improves sufficiently to convince them otherwise.*** The way OP wants to go about reworking public transport here only vindicates the choice made by these newfound motorists.Realism is a nice thing to have when looking at policy issues, but like all nice things, there isn't enough of it, and unfortunately it's not found in the OP's post either. He writes that the ""build it and they will come"" mentality is no longer applicable to new rail lines, and thus implies that ridership on newer rail lines must be ***forced*** (from cutting parallel bus routes, as has been done for the DTL twice in 2020 and 2021). OP should ask himself how much can actually be squeezed out of bus ridership before the detrimental effects of service cuts to the overall network structure does more harm than good in encouraging people to take public transport rather than drive. In a similar vein, the argument that the large-scale bus service cuts that were initiated from the MRT's early days up to the early 2000s should be continued reflects a lack of awareness of the current conditions of the system. With newer rail lines featuring smaller trains that max out at lower demand, bus cuts should be done minimally, only for routes that do not already have the ridership to justify themselves, nor a unique sector that cannot be served by amending other routes. This is not to say that we cannot ***reorganise*** the bus system -- we certainly can and should, but we must be conscious of the final outcome being a *net increase* in service, rather than a decrease, as is the case now.In the middle of his post OP brings up the name that almost every Singaporean now associates with the MRT -- Ong Teng Cheong. In the context of the arguments OP was making (he was arguing that buses were the cause of rush hour traffic), this appeal to authority is irrelevant, and stricter critics would find this a highly dishonest portrayal of Ong's legacy, where it should have been one of seeking constant reform, to fix what isn't broke before it breaks. Until we can cover every last inch of Singapore soil with rail, it is equally disingenuous to claim, as OP subtly implies, that rail rapid transit is the silver bullet for all of Singapore's public transport issues. For one, that would be a reckless waste of taxpayer money, itself a problem asking to be fixed.Since OP loves to view things from a money-minded perspective, here's a money-minded response to a money-minded take on public transport operational cost. Billions of dollars spent on ""underutilised"" MRT lines? According to the ADB, Singapore loses anywhere between[ 8 and 20 billion SGD]( ***every year*** to traffic congestion. By comparison, that's how much an **\*entire\*** rail line costs here. Even the scary ""S$2.5 billion"" annual subsidy is insignificant compared to this, when you recall that this sum is how much is paid out to subsidise ALL train services, as well as all buses too. These rail lines are already paying for themselves from the day they commence revenue service, by reducing congestion on the road and saving the national economy the financial penalty of traffic! This is why it remains important to target motorists to induce a mode shift to public transport -- it is how these rail lines recoup their costs! A dozen billion saved every year from reduced traffic will sufficiently pay off the entire MRT network's construction cost within 10 years! Talk about improving service first, and the financial rewards will be more than proportionate to the extra sum invested.To OP, if you're reading this, no hard feelings bro, just helping you clarify confused public transport lingo",Transport,-0.7,0.95,0.8,-0.997,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/17qk2n0/in_response_to_a_recent_rsingapore_post_on_how_to/,Reddit,8/11/2023 11:59

t3_17sqnk0,North-South Corridor: A Progress or Peril for Singaporeans?,"The North South Corridor (NSC) is a multi-modal transportation corridor/expressway that is currently under construction in Singapore. It was first announced as the North South Expressway on 30 January 2008. This year, 2023, was when it was expected to be completed. NSC is expected to bring some benefits to Singaporeans, such as reduced travel times and improved connectivity, it also has had a number of negative impacts. Let's look at the issues observed thus far.&#x200B;**Delay in Construction Timeline**NSC was initially planned with an expected completion date of 2023. Then 2024, 2026 and 2027. The latest news is that it will be fully completed only in 2029, 6 years later than previously announced. The delay is partially due to Covid-19 disruptions - but covid disruptions isn't even half as long as the delay. Other challenges include challenging terrain conditions and land acquisitions.&#x200B;**Localized** **Pollution**Residents near the NSC have been affected by noise and air pollution, and some residents even reported trembles in their blocks. Construction activities often run late into the night. Although LTA said that it avoids noisier construction activities at night, mainstream news have reported otherwise. Air pollution from construction activities are often underreported due to the fact that no government agency actively monitors the surrounding air quality at construction sites.&#x200B;**Travel Inconvenience**Travel from North to South and you will see the countless road diversions and bus stop re-locations. For road users, the diversion of traffic have led to confusion, longer travel times and congestions. For public transport users, it means travelling to a further temporary bus stop, often without original supporting infrastructure such as shelters and proper walkways. As somebody who can only afford public transport, this frustrates me the most. Walking is tough, and cycling on pedestrian paths is next to impossible due to conditions of the makeshift roads. LTA has also shifted 4 bus stops in the vicinity (and all of them further than before) and they won't bother building sheltered walkways for the ""temporary"" bus stops for the next 6 years.&#x200B;**Health Impact**Higher levels of air and noise pollutions arise from the increased traffic and increased construction activity. This cause respiratory problems and other health issues, and negatively impacts sleep quality and mental health.&#x200B;I'm aware of other issues concerning the environment and businesses but I would leave them up to you guys to share. We all know that NSC is a major infrastructure project that is likely to have a significant impact on Singapore roads in the future. However, I thought that it is important to be aware of both the benefits and negative impacts of the project, especially since the delay means that current stakeholders will have to endure these issues for a longer period. In my opinion, the government can take further steps to mitigate the negative impacts of the project.

t3_18dpn01,"On recent bus amendments (75, 121, 162/M, 167, 859) -- and a possible solution to retain 167?","[Where next? -- STC]( all the roar has been around the proposed amendments around a couple of bus services in the city area because yadada their ridership fell and TEL ridership tripled. What's more worthy of noting is what is in store for us in the years to come, as this round of service cuts is showing us. Attached above is my take on the recent TEL3 rationalisation exercise. It comes a bit late, but comes with the benefit of seeing how the entire saga played out between unhappy residents, the media, and LTA themselves.Alright, enough negativity. Here's something I'd like to add to all the hate against 167 getting withdrawn, or degraded to 30 minute frequency: here's a proposal to make it more financially viable, without having to sacrifice any of the other ""duplicating"" bus routes (ie 162, 980) either! Spoilers for those eager to hear: make 167 faster than the rest. Read the article to end for full details :>Anyways, spread the word, and let's hope we can all save 167 through our collective action against the profiteering calculations of those in power.

t3_18lto70,What can I do about this? Is it my fault?,"Apologies, this may seem out of place and I'm looking for a place to rant and for opinions. Overall really frustrated and done with this situation.On the 19th September 2023, Singapore Polytechnic (SP) sent an email to graduates (me) informing them of their graduation. Specifically stated, they said that the Diplomas will be sent via courier service to our mailing addresses by end of November 2023. This is due to no graduation ceremony being held for this specific PACE courseLo and behold, they suddenly say that there will be a ceremony held by Maritime & Port Authority (MPA) instead of SP. I confirmed my non-attendance not only because I had my own work on that day, but also because I'm not really interested enough in the ceremony to warrant a day off.Long story short, the Diploma did not come. I waited and waited. Graduation ceremony came and gone, long past. So I emailed SP, and they replied that the Diplomas had been handed over to MPA. Ok sure, as long as I got it. They also CCed MPA in the email for further action.A week came and went with no response too. I was already very impatient because it was taking way too long. So I emailed them again urgently stating for a quick and proper resolution to this issue.Then, on 19th December 2023, more than 3 months after the first email and half a month after the ""before end of November"" deadline, MPA emails me. This time saying that I have to go all the way down to their headquarters to collect the Diploma. I live way North and the headquarters are way down south.Well obviously I probably have no choice but to go for the 2 and a half hour round trip to collect the Diploma. But I'm incredibly pissed and upset at their messy way of handling things, and lack of transparency.Is there anything I can do to properly voice out my displeasure? I don't want them to get away with it with a slap on the wrist.

t3_18y8804,Opinion: Most of Singapore's current problems is due to overpopulation,"Just got to thinking about most of the problems that people around me tend to complain about which made me come to a conclusion that many of these problems are due to the sheer number of people cramped on a tiny island vying for too little resources, and that many of these problems could be resolved if we could hypothetically reduce the population drastically.A couple of issues I was thinking about. &#x200B;1. **Housing Crisis**: The long queues for houses and the frustrating process of applying for BTOs (Build-To-Order flats), often leading to multiple rejections or settling for less desirable units, are clear indicators of overpopulation. The demand far exceeds the supply, leaving various groups, including singles and the LGBT community, struggling to find a place in this tight market. This housing crunch is a direct result of too many people vying for limited space. The ratio of buyers to available units are 10, 12 or even 15 times the number of actual availability. Imagine a group of 10 sharing a meal meant for one.2. **Overburdened Public Services**: The strain on public services is evident in the long queues at polyclinics and the difficulty in securing medical or dental appointments. Hospitals are overwhelmed, struggling to provide beds even for those with severe health conditions. This pressure on healthcare systems is a consequence of having too many people needing services that are limited in capacity. Try to get an appointment at any polyclinic it is impossible. Try to get one at a dental clinic, you need to queue many months in advance. Doctors and nurses are overburdened. Even beyond healthcare, everything else is jammed up from usage of public gyms to public transport to public parks. Everything a facility is made available for public, you can imagine 1000 others going for the exact same thing. Pools are filled to the brim, parks are crowded a f, malls are crowded and all F&B are fully seated, Gyms have 3 people waiting for one station.3. **Automobile Affordability**: In many parts of the world, owning a car is within reach for the average person. In Singapore, however, the limited car quotas, designed to control traffic and pollution, lead to exorbitant prices, putting car ownership beyond the reach of many. This issue stems from the sheer number of people competing for a limited number of vehicles. Everyone bids and outbids each other because there are too many people. This then pushes people to public transport, which itself is extremely overburdened.4. **Educational Access**: Gaining admission to kindergartens and primary schools has become a competitive ordeal. Parents find themselves queuing, balloting, and often struggling to secure spots for their children in preferred institutions. This intense competition for educational opportunities is another symptom of overpopulation. At the tertiary level its the same, there are only so many slots universities and trade schools can accomodate. 5. **Job Market Saturation**: The Singapore job market is disproportionately small compared to the population size. While many multinational companies establish headquarters here, the local market potential remains limited. So companies aren't here for the market they are here for the knowledge, tax incentives, etc. But there is just too few of such jobs having to serve such a large population. The result is an excessive number of applicants for a finite number of positions, leading to high competition and job market saturation.6. **Leisure Activities and Space**: Even leisure activities in Singapore require planning and competition. From booking concert tickets to dining in restaurants, everything needs to be pre-arranged and often balloted for. The scarcity of leisure opportunities and space is another byproduct of having too many people in a limited area. If there's an interesting event, I don't even bother booking because either you can't get a ticket or it will be too crowded. Look at Geylang Serai Market, or Coldplay Concert, etc. The relentless presence of crowds is a constant in Singaporean life. From squeezing onto public transport to queuing for nearly every aspect of daily living, the stress and unhappiness many feel can be traced back to overpopulation. There's a stark contrast when visiting neighboring countries, where one can instantly sense the abundance of space and resources (albeit managed not as well as Singapore, in fact pretty poorly in some places), unlike the scarcity and cramped conditions in Singapore. One queues to squeeze in public transport, to get to a job one has to queue for, to raise a family one has to queue to support from education to healthcare to leisure, just to queue for a house that is not easily available. Singapore is an island with no resources, no land, and surrounded by a climate that makes us feel really uncomfortable. But we have 6 million people that are fighting each other for very little resources. That's why everyone is so unhappy.What do you guys think?",Housing,-0.9,0.95,0.9,-0.8355,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/18y8804/opinion_most_of_singapores_current_problems_is/,Reddit,4/1/2024 8:26

t3_193765e,EZ-Link Card and SimplyGo (and how transition could have been done better.),"Ok with this new move by our Transport authorities, I can try to explain how the Old CEPAS Cards compare to current SimplyGo Cards, and how to be safe.Old CEPAS EZ-Link cards are storage-based cards, basically think of it like your SD Card/USB Stick. Cause the money is stored in the card itself, the card shows its balance when boarding busses/trains/slotted into IU for cars. Issues with the system is say for example you lost the adult card, you basically lost money in it unless you remember the 16 digit CAN ID on the back of said card (since its anonymous), or you linked it to the EZ-Link app back in the day. This is different from Concession cards (the ones with ur IC, name and Face on it), since the authorities have more info to track said card and return the money back.New SimplyGo cards are account-based cards, like your Google Drive account. The money is stored on servers with SimplyGo. I believe the data transmission to the card from servers is to strive between allowing you to board public transport and what relevant info to tell you on card reader hence you cannot see the balance (take my words with salt, Im basing it on experience with TL Staff and observations). Also, you have to not only maintain a balance of minimum $3 (or else you cant use the card for 2 days lol), top-ups recommends 10 minutes to update the servers (probably thought of as a small issue since you probably have to wait for a bus but still). One thing about SimplyGo is that if you lost said card and block it, you can transfer the money to your new card. But no inserting to IU, no card balance reading.Honestly felt that the authorities should have done a different way.1. Announce suspension of adult CEPAS card issuance and begin sales of only SimplyGo Cards. (They are doing the 2nd part run)2. Honour remaining CEPAS cards to their Expiry3. Improve the SimplyGo app, quite buggy still.4. Innovate to allow card balance to be readable at the card reader.If we can remove the 1 cent coin from issuance with no issue, why cant we still keep old CEPAS Adult cards as legal tender?",Transport,-0.7,0.9,0.7,0.6952,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/193765e/ezlink_card_and_simplygo_and_how_transition_could/,Reddit,10/1/2024 12:28

He has a particular disability that may affect his social ques but more or less he's like any other ordinary kid. He's a good kid. A kind soul to everyone. He's trying to be friendly to his new classmates but kids from his previous school that know him have already started bullying him.They ""ambushed"" him in a room and just started screaming at him. While he's too scared to recollect what they said or what happened, he just remembers screaming and cursing. Amazingly enough, the bullies did this during recess where many people saw it happening. If that wasn't enough, they invited him to a WhatsApp group where they threatened him and insulted him even more. Luckily the messages were screenshoted. He rightly reported it to his parents and his mother called his form teacher but from what I know the kids were just given a warning. This incident really boils my blood to no end.

Whereas EZ-Link just need to - take out card,- check the amount shown is correct then- tap.The down side is need to regularly top up card at kiosk (and more tech savvy can top up via app), and lose money if card misplaced.

We'd need to determine a smart number for X. Alternatively, or maybe more simply, HDB could allow rental contracts for these properties to match the length of the remaining lease, say up to 10 years, instead of the current 2-year maximum.This could address the need for cash for those with leases too short to re-sale effectively, while also expanding the rental housing supply.

A day before the salary and bonus payout, we were informed that there is a delay in bonus payment and were ensured via email that we will be paid within the end of next week, which was already due by now.A separate department announcement was also made to assure each one of us that the bonus will be paid, with an estimated timeline of 1 - 2 weeks, which will be due this Friday. We were informed at todays department that there was no update regarding the bonus payout and hopefully it will be paid out within CNY period but could not provide a definite payment date. Therefore, I have informed my manager of my intention to resign and asked if the company could consider to offset a one month notice period in view of the bonus owed to me but was rejected on the basis that I am only entitled when it is paid out. I was advised to either wait for the bonus payout, which might be paid by next week or maybe by end of the month and again could not provide a definite payment date.In view of the above, I wanted to know if I could legally claim that I am entitled to the bonus or if there is any government agency that I could reach out to.Many thanks in advance!",Employment,-0.8,0.9,0.8,0.9869,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1al1qo9/owed_bonus_and_tendered_resignation/,Reddit,7/2/2024 12:25

Nearby I saw 2 guys (a Caucasian and a Filipino) dressed up formally with a collared shirt, smart pants and a tie and holding a book which says The Book Of Mormon. I didnt take much into it but then the Caucasian guy started wishing Xinnian Kuaile to a middle aged Chinese lady next to them.

But then they moved the subject about church and that theyre missionaries from the Mormon Church and asked her whether shes willing to have a church session with them on Zoom. At that point it was pretty obvious they were just preaching people into their church and after some talking she alighted.

t3_1anw2v8,Street-hail rides dwindle as Singapores taxi population continues to shrink,"me, I personally prefer using Grab or other hailing app, because it can come to my position. Also, the earlier frustration of wanting to get a taxi but cannot get one, either on the street or via phone call. (Situation more than 10 years ago, so grab is a very useful service to humanities. )Overall, there is more good than bad. Also, the attitude of the grab driver is better as the app have a rating feature. I think we should just give them 5 stars if everything is ok, dont need expect too much, as long as they are courteous and get us to the right location. I think taxi still have a place in Singapore. Earlier, I thought to support taxi, and book taxi using grab system, so that the taxi driver can drive relax, and I pay the meter fares accordingly, instead of fixed fare. When I feedback this to the taxi driver, they agrees too. However there is one incident, I notice that the fare entered is higher than the metered fare. It could be an oversight or something by the driver. The thing is if I did not take the picture of the fares. And the fares entered in is higher, I have no recourse. So everything is dependent on the taxi driver keying in of the fares.Taking a picture of the fares at the end of each trip gives the impression of not trusting the driver. The ideal situation is if there is a linkage between the metered fares and the app, but I believed this requires high level integration, and I dont believe there will be the effort done, even though it will benefit everyone. I think grab also want to take care of their own PHV.Right now, I will alternate between justgrab(fixed fare) and GrabTaxi (meter fare)",Transport,-0.7,0.85,0.6,0.9902,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1anw2v8/streethail_rides_dwindle_as_singapores_taxi/,Reddit,11/2/2024 1:27

t3_1apf9lk,An Idea to Reduce Taxi Queue Times at Changi Airport,"So I had the fortune (or misfortune) of departing from Changi Airport Terminal 2 at 1AM this morning (13 Feb). As you can imagine, there was an influx of passengers via air, all returning from their holidays abroad or coming for their holiday, after escaping CNY with their families. All of them were seeking to catch a grab or taxi out of Changi Airport, myself included.My experience was unfortunate to say the least. I joined the taxi queue at 1, and only got my ride at 01:53AM (according to my taxi receipt). When I joined the queue, it was only half the length seen in the picture. It doubled and kept growing as I was leaving. Everyone was also trying to get a grab at the same time and nothing was working. Youd see one victor escaping the queue but that was few and far in between.It's not an ideal experience, especially when you're a visitor, arriving to see the famed Singaporean efficiency, only to be greeted with an hour long wait for taxi. It's one of the first experiences you have as a tourist and does set the expectation for the rest of the trip. This got me thinking, don't we have data that we can use to predict passenger volume and groups. Using the data of passengers arriving, we can figure out how many taxis and grabs are needed, coordinate between the transport companies to ensure adequate supply and that wait times are manageable for a grumpy passenger arriving after a long flight. There might be some incentivisation problem (how to entice the drivers to come) but we can use data to improve the experience.any other ideas that you can think of?",Transport,-0.7,0.9,0.8,0.9541,https://i.redd.it/jv7n392ju8ic1.jpeg,Reddit,13/2/2024 0:03

Well look no further.&#x200B;# # PrefaceI've been a rentee for several years now. Early years was OK but lately it has been a horrible experience finding a rental based on articles on Reddit and even news of scams finding rental in Singapore. Getting in contact to view the rental unit was difficult with many arrogant agents and landlords not responding to questions. From what I've read here on Reddit and a few other sites, agents even make rentees bid on the rental pushing up the price even further.&#x200B;&#x200B;Some of these rental units don't even deserve to be stayed in. You might have seen news like this([ where there's just one mattress in a tiny and no windows whatsoever.Even after landing a unit, I keep hearing of landlords making the stay at the unit a living hell. They want you to leave earlier so that they can claim the deposit for themselves. One case I've heard was really bad with the deposit withheld in the range of $8000+.The rental situation is so bad in Singapore that there even exist a dedicated FB group talking about horrible rental and landlords: facebookdotcom/groups/SGroomblacklist/Fed up with viewing listing after listing, I gathered a bunch of listings and analysed them to help with my rental search and after collecting rental data for 3+ years, I'm glad to share my analysis on Singapore's absurd rental market.&#x200B;Check out this site for FREE access to the analysis tool: [ reading a wall of text.

Landlords have been increasingly shown to not care for general populace and only increase rentals for their own gain. It is even more disgusting when you see the rules some of the landlord put up for the rental like ""no cooking"", ""no visitors"" and one of them worse I've seen: ""no cooked or raw food in the fridge"". I mean, you want to rent out your extra space, at least make them the person staying feel at home and not like a person that owes you money or living in a prison.&#x200B;Rentees need to band together to put pressure and stop this vicious cycle of landlords taking rentees' hard-earned money.

Start by selecting a date range of data to analyze followed by filtering down to the name of the listing (e.g. Block 123 in ABC Avenue) or address/location(e.g. Toa Payoh).&#x200B;The results on the graph shows the 'heat' of the prices starting from cheapest at the top and most expensive at the top. This helps compare the price range of the location you're considering to rent and similar listings within the same attribute(i.e. same address, region, etc., with air con, etc.) Compare these results to the rental you are viewing and consider to checkout the cheaper listings and look away if it's way above the average or median market price.&#x200B;Another very helpful feature is to check the 'history' of a rental listing. If you look at recent listings, occasionally you may find some are duplicates as they have the same listing picture, description, etc. This may mean that the listing is not good, whether the price is too high or that they may be some other underlying issue that is not apparent in the listing until one does a visit to the unit.&#x200B;&#x200B;# ## LimitationsDue to the likely possibility that not all users are looking for rent and some may be landlords, I've decided to hide a certain % of the listings as to favor rentees.

This is where subsidised education comes in. Education is one of the best forms of uplifting one's financial situation in life. To equip the youth with skills and knowledge they can use. To support them in this pursuit. I'm not even pushing for 100% free, knowing the out cries that will come. I'm saying let's consider it. Let's consider our budget and see how much we can subsidised.

The ads strategy used for the agency marketing for this game seems to be able to bypass Google's algo to still display it AGAINST user preference. 2)Why is it inappropriate? I was turning on a documentary for my kids on my youtube account when a video of this game popped up (mind you I have flagged it up a few times before as an ad I do not want to see). The video shows some demon swallowing the hero which is completely not appropriate for my kids.3) The ads shown are completely not what the actual game is. The Ads showed the game as a puzzle game but in actual fact its an AFK teambuilder game.4) I have literally avoided using youtube now as I am honestly sick of seeing that same ads in various for and guess what I see when I check my Reddit feeds....TLDR: This Hero wars ads not inappropriate for kids and is not representative of the game but there is not way you can block it.Anyone sharing the same woes please voice it out here.

t3_1bg2fj2,Ideas welcome: ways to make sure every company and group do their part for NSmen,"Hi! Following the two flared-up subs on the Ipsos gender study, a lot of the dissatisfaction comes from NS. I also mentioned that nobody should be let off the hook in making sacrifices, even if men have to be the only ones serving the 2 years and >10 years of reservist.A huge problem is that while its compulsory for the NSmen to make sacrifices, it is optional for almost every other party to do so. Groups and companies can thus get away with doing bare minimum for NSmen, while they do everything for women in particular. So we see very few of them give NSmen an official salary hike (public sector does it, private - not that I heard of), or added insurance, career and mental wellness benefits. So Im suggesting some ideas to make sure we all say it loud and clear that short-changing our NSmen is unacceptable and must be punished. If you have more to add on, pls comment in this sub.-Every group or company must prioritize NSmen for 80% of open job roles at all grades. This includes interview stages.-Every NSmen must be provided with an additional support grant from both the government and company to pay for mental health support and insurance against injuries or key illnesses. (Makes sense since men do suffer from stigma and stereotypes too, so why make them serve and then deny them accessible help?)-Every NSman is entitled to a basic level of support in their career journey, be it mentorship and counselling programmes. This must be on top of what every other citizen gets.-If a company sponsors a certain amount for women, it must sponsor at least 1.5x that amount for NSmen.-companies which fail to support NSmen are to be investigated and punished with fines, suspensions, confiscation of bonuses from executives (which can be used to benefit other NSmen), grant revocation, or other corrective measures. More serious cases will be referred to court.-companies which are foreign public-listed could have complaints lodged against them in their local stock exchanges. I heard that some of them want their companies to have diversity quotas so this should also ensure that NSmens interests are not misted by this. I think these ideas ensure that the sacrifices are more equitably shared among as many parties as possible. So it doesnt have to be the government bearing 100% of costs.",Employment,-0.7,0.95,0.9,0.9753,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1bg2fj2/ideas_welcome_ways_to_make_sure_every_company_and/,Reddit,16/3/2024 9:43

t3_1bhnlvg,Annual Leave and Singaporeans' Well-Being,"While we talk a lot about the poor TFR, enhanced paternity leave scheme and general unhappiness with work/life balance, I noticed that we rarely discuss annual leave.The Employment Act mandates only 7 days' minimum annual leave, but I wonder what effect it would have on overall well-being and maybe even TFR if we revised it significantly upwards, say to a minimum 20 days, both to provide more paid free time and also to signify a change in mindset.The MOM stats tabled in Parliament in 2023 show the following leave breakdown by monthly wage levels:Below $2,000: 12.4 days$2,000 - 4,999: 16.3 days$5,000+: 20.4 daysIt seems to me, with the bulk of our grads and youngsters in the below $5,000 range, a move to 20 days annual leave would give them more time in their relative youth for hobbies, self-discovery and maybe to form relationships earlier in life. Better than a once-off two week paternity leave bonus, giving around one working week extra every year will also allow parents more time to spend with their children as they grow up.Allied to this, there needs to be an effort to ensure that all leave is taken and not forfeited / cashed in. It goes without saying that given our deleterious working culture, there are workplaces where this never happens. I suspect the MOM figures really only tell half the story; I used to regularly get shafted on annual leave myself.What do you all think?*Bearing in mind also that the higher two figures may be skewed upwards as many MNCs already provide 20/25 days' annual leave based on their global internal policies.",Employment,-0.7,0.9,0.7,0.9601,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1bhnlvg/annual_leave_and_singaporeans_wellbeing/,Reddit,18/3/2024 10:37

t3_1bik5jf,Where I believe it goes wrong with the NS narrative,"(The following contains my personal opinion, and is very long)Im sure many SG redditors are keenly aware of the high levels of discontent here regarding NS. It is bad enough that those aggrieved will hang it over the heads of others whenever any attempt is made to improve/change their situation(Most obvious examples, any attempts to push for more gender equality/inclusive policies)In this post, I will try my best to put into words what I believe is the root of much of this unhappiness(apart from the obvious 2 years service), and try to focus on what went wrong or is going wrong in terms of the messaging around NS, as well as how it causes a knock-on effect against other social causes.Based of personal experience of my time in school, it starts with the some teachers/authority figures who openly or subtly assert that there is some level of equality being practiced due to the assumption that, as a societal whole, singaporean men serve NS as their duty, and singaporean women will marry singaporean men and bear children which is a narrative parroted by some figures to be Womens NS. They further assert or imply that male Singaporeans are emotionally immature or deficient, painting everyone with the same brush regardless of personal circumstances. This will be cured by NS, and it will make a man out of you. At this point, Im sure that some eyebrows are raised internally, after all, does that mean that men of other places are not men? Are we specially immature or undeserving of our place in our country till we have gone through this rite of passage?All this within the context of the already harrowing Singapore education system that is known to be one of the most stressful in the world. We are all taught around this time that the only place we deserve is the one we carve out for ourselves. No one is going to help us up if we fall, no one is going to save us if we screw up.This continues once NS starts, with the pushing of the belief that all the suffering and sacrifices the men go through will be worth it as this service is a form of contribution to a society that they will fully partake in (which implies, subtly or not so subtly, a wife, nice job, a nice 4-5 room BTO by the time youre in your late 20s early 30s etc.) in a country they can happily call their own. And then NS is done, youre given a little ceremony, and off you go. Some will continue on to university, others to work. This is where things start to fall apart for a significant number of these people. Many will realise that there is little to no actual benefit directly derived from their service. They still have to participate in a fully open and globalised economy, with and in many instances against others who are just as able, or more capable than them. What grieves them even more are many stories of hiring discrimination from managers/HRs of other nationalities, who take advantage of their countrys relatively open economic system to bing in kin and countrymen into many high paying and comfortable white collar jobs.A large number of Singaporeans have also been polled to have never even dated before. [ would cause another dent in the narrative that these people have been brought up by. Without a partner, there is no possibility of applying for a BTO until youre almost middle aged. This feeling of exclusion worsens when the real or perceived social phenomenon of Singaporean women being able to marry foreign grooms, and still having their family fully getting the privileges of citizenship/residence.[ of these families will have essentially no members of the family serving a single day, and will still receive full benefits, rights and protections under Singapore law, assuming they choose to reside in Singapore.In terms of housing, apart from being excluded from the coveted HDB BTO scheme as mentioned, almost none of them will be able to afford a home in their own country either, with average condominium prices around $2 million dollars. The same goes for owning cars, which many see as part of natural next step in fulfilling their ambitions in this country.So if you can imagine, now youre a man whos been told that their mandatory rite of passage that was supposed to turn you into men and usher you into a fulfilling life in your own country, and are now faced with one or more of the above. Many have no wife, no children, no house, no car. They dont even have any specific government privileges to help them if they cant find a job or advance their position in life for their service. This is the crux of the problem. Now youve got a whole bunch of unhappy people who feel cheated of a life they were promised. Theyre not going to be able to easily swallow societal or governmental pushes for gender equality, because they feel theyve already been treated must unequally. Never mind that many of the issues that these initiatives seek to tackle are real and legitimate issues that many women face in their lives. The problem also lies in these people, who channel their unhappiness and vitriol to women who have had no part in the broken promises or the suffering their going through (and no, some stupid comment made by some schoolgirl on NS handpicked to be in a street interview video made with the objective of going viral doesnt count).They are not able to see that many perceived injustices they have gone through are perpetrated by powerful men part of Singapores social elite. These are the people who, knowingly or unknowingly, perpetuate a structural belief that there would be some social benefit to the 2 years served that would outweigh its service, when in actuality they have failed in their duty to implement real laws and initiatives to make service worth it and be recognised.One man serves his 2 years, and goes home to a landed estate. The other serves his two years and goes home to a rental flat with 3 generations staying together. Both are taught to believe that their service is to benefit their future.I believe that those in power MUST come to terms with the reality that the continued perpetuation of this narrative is harmful not only to those that have to serve, but also to those that have to live with those that serve. A country that has a significant proportion of its citizens go about life in the belief that they have been fucked will soon realise that their frustrations will be heard one way or another, and when it does, it is not likely to be pleasant.Change must be made to be honest to those who are about to serve that it is a straight sacrifice, with no real benefit directly tied to its service, to allow those that are put through it to have an honest reality of what being done to them. Only then can there be some level of accountability between those that serve NS and those that most benefit from it.TLDR: Please change how NS is presented, how its being done now, either knowingly or by wilful ignorance, is not good for our country.",Politics,-0.9,0.95,0.9,0.8283,https://i.redd.it/j1bt1xj2lapc1.jpeg,Reddit,19/3/2024 13:23

t3_1bozftp,What are some current practices in Singapore that a more enlightened population in 50 years will look back on with disapproval?,"I'll go first:1. death penalty - I know the merits of this one is controversial, but globally, there is an undeniable trend towards abolition of the death penalty. So, it makes sense to reason that a hypothetical Singapore in 50 years will similarly look back on death penalty disapprovingly, even though there will be a segment of the population who thinks it was a mistake to abolish it.2. non-equal gay rights - not according them the right to marriage, or some other form of legal recognition eg civil union. same as above, likely controversial, even 50 years from now, similar to how there are some people in countries who have legalized gay marriage today who think it's a mistake still.3. treating low-skilled migrant workers as sub-humans - this post was partially inspired by the news of a migrant worker getting seriously injured after being transported in the back of a lorry, a practice that is illegal for everyone except low-skilled migrant workers. I think this one is the least controversial, and everyone will regard this as a stain on the country's moral history. Absolute shame on the ministers and politicians who can defend this in parliament on the pretext of corporate profitability.4. CIMO model - as more interracial marriages take place and the lines between ethnicities get more blurred, I think the CIMO model will be increasingly irrelevant until it is abolished, and future generations will be shocked that people were pigeon holed into arbitrary categories.Hoping for a serious discussion, it's a fun exercise to try to think critically of the present from the lens of the future!",Legal,-0.8,0.9,0.9,-0.9905,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1bozftp/what_are_some_current_practices_in_singapore_that/,Reddit,27/3/2024 11:21

t3_1bs0rc5,What was something you were taught in school that turned out to be false?,"Was inspired by [this video]( from Scott Manley to make this post. It hasnt been that long (less than 10 years) since I graduated from primary and secondary school. So the things I was taught back then, havent gotten out of date that quickly yet. But here are the ones I can remember: Around 2011, my science class taught that when you breathe out, you exhale mostly carbon dioxide. If this were true, then CPR wouldnt work lol. The air you breathe out is 4-5% carbon dioxide, which is still 100x more than the outside air, but you wouldnt call that percentage mostly. By the time of my PSLE exam, that part has been corrected. In secondary school, during a total defence day ~~propaganda copium sharing~~, one of the teachers was sharing about our military defence. He talked about our submarines and how stealthy they were. He said our submarines were so stealthy that they were able to sink a US carrier by going up to one and taking a picture. Except that never happened. It happened to submarines owned by Sweden and Australia using the same type of propulsion as our submarines, but not our submarines themselves. And even this situation is not as easy as it sounds. The teacher then went on a tangent about the Falklands War. That teacher said that the British submarines were so stealthy that the Argentine Navy were too scared to sink any British ships for fear of retaliation. The only casualties of the entire naval war were a few whales that were blown up because the British thought they were submarines. The blowing up whales part is [true]( but everything else was horseshit. The British [sunk the Argentinian warship General Belgrano]( and afterwards, the Argentines were so spooked by the submarines that their fleet retreated back to port. However, several British warships were sunk in the Falklands War, [by aircraft using the Exocet anti-ship missile]( or [by aircraft dropping bombs]( Saying that nobody died during the naval war is literally misinformation. I mean come on, this was 2016, the internet exists, you can just Google this stuff.

We are paying top rate road taxes, ERP, and COE internationally, so why is LTA & MOT unable to install such user friendly features in our traffic lights?",Transport,-0.8,0.95,0.8,0.3736,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1bww83o/singapore_should_install_countdown_timer_on_all/,Reddit,5/4/2024 23:11
t3_1bwwnyk,It should be a crime with heavy fine to use phone loudly,"Currently warded in hospital for a few days now, and it frustrates and angers me that even in hospitals with sick, tired and worried patients, there are selfish and inconsiderate people who talk on their phone or watch videos with loudspeakers on.Was finally transferred to a permanent ward bed after 2 days waiting for a bed in the hospital holding area and I thought I will have a better chance to rest. But no, I share the ward with other patients and unfortunately, one of them is an uncle who watches videos with loudspeaker on, like the kind usually encountered in buses and trains.Days of no food, only iv drips and blood transfusions and I still have to suffer this unnecessary noise.I regret that I lost my temper and shouted at him last night to please use earpiece. The nurse came to tell him in dialect also and he stopped. Some Singaporeans are too helpless, clueless and inconsiderate that only laws and fines are needed to herd them and make them follow basic etiquette. Throwing litter when there are so many bins around? Need fines. Cleaning tables after eating? Need fines. List goes on, unnecessary laws where basic good manners and etiquette should have been enough.Should it be the same for people using their phones loudly in buses, trains? Perhaps fines will not totally stop them but at least will make them think twice. It is also frustrating that staff like bus captains and hospital staff almost do nothing to stop such behaviour. It is an added task for them but I think they are people of authority who can do something about this before others take matters into their hands.",Public Safety,-0.9,0.9,0.9,-0.9874,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1bwwnyk/it_should_be_a_crime_with_heavy_fine_to_use_phone/,Reddit,5/4/2024 23:30

t3_1c0c69q,Designated smoking points to address the issue of secondhand smoke,"**Concerned Citizen's Appeal:**You spent a lot of money on a BTO, designing and renovating it. You envision yourself spending a long time with your loved one, raising young kids, working and growing old in this place.Then it turns out that a neighbour smokes. The smoke wafts into your house, forcing you to close the windows. Fine; just a minor annoyance, right? But as days go by, you start to stress out with uncertainty. When will the smoke come today? Should I keep my windows closed permanently? But I saved up so much for it, why do I need to sacrifice my enjoyment/ventilation because of another persons life choices?And let's not forget the impact on our children. We've invested so much in their well-being, sacrificing our own careers and comfort to provide them with the best possible start in life. Yet, here they are, exposed to yet another health hazard that they don't deserve.We've tried diplomacy, reaching out to our neighbors in the hopes of finding a solution. But too often, our pleas fall on deaf ears or are met with indifference. And the government, while acknowledging the problem, offers little more than platitudes and excuses. It's disheartening, to say the least.Designated Smoking Points (DSPs) have been proposed as a potential solution, providing smokers with a designated space to indulge while protecting the health and well-being of non-smokers. However, little information has come out of that initiative thus far. Yes, there would be costs involved in setting up and maintaining these areas, but when weighed against the toll of inaction, they seem like a small price to pay.So here's my call to action: let's push for renewed piloting and experimentation of DSPs in HDB blocks. It's time to move beyond the gridlock of inaction and take concrete steps towards finding a solution that works for everyone. And if we can gather enough support, I'm more than willing to take our cause to our representatives, to ensure that our voices are heard.Together, we can make a difference.

t3_1ca5bmi,Need help: Shopee not paying me for my work,"So just to cut to the chase, I recently got a job but I decided to moonlight on the side due to my new job's working hours sometimes leaving me with so much more free time during the day. I got on an app called EL Connect, which outsources me to any ad-hoc jobs, be it working at McDonald's, hotels and whatnotI signed up to work at a warehouse as a parcel sorter for Shopee on the 6th of April. How attendance-taking works is that you must scan a QR code, get to a Google form, fill it up, and then send a screenshot to a group chat to officially sign in and out. On the 19th of April, almost TWO WEEKS later, I get a text from EL Connect, claiming that I have not sent a screenshot to the group chat and hence will have payment deducted from my account. Maybe I did, maybe I didn't, but I had no way to prove anything because it's been nearly two weeks and I was scrambling for anything in my gallery to prove my attendanceSee, the thing is, there are two QR codes on site. I have to scan EL Connect's QR code to clock out on my end, and also SPX's QR code to send them a report of my attendance. It being my first time there, I probably forgot about this after a long overnight shift and wanting to go home. It's a mistake on my part, but what really infuriates me is that they come to me nearly TWO WEEKS later to come take away my payment and essentially make me work for free for a mistake I did two weeks ago. Why wasn't I chased sooner?What's more, this entire thing has illegal or shady written all over it; Surely a company like Shopee can't just stop at ""You made an honest mistake and didn't send this one form to us, so we're not paying you""? Is that *really* all the effort they can put in? I have SO many eyewitnesses there who can confirm my existence. Why not message or call the person in-charge at the time instead of telling me that she ""left"" the WhatsApp group? I don't care what you say, nothing changes the fact that I spent an overnight shift without having slept properly the day prior and I'm the reason why your parcels got to where they needed to be that night. So far they have settled for $30 as ""goodwill"" for reimbursement but I do not wish to settle for less. I am intending on going to TAFEP, but from what I heard, they aren't much help sometimes. Can anyone here with some good legal advice or experience in legal help tell me if any of this is right? $110 may not be that much but it still makes me upset because it's still good, hard-earned money and I don't think it's right for me to just turn over and accept this. I know that gig work may not be the most reliable in this aspect and I used to be screwed over because of shenanigans like this when I was a teenager, but now I am a young working adult and I don't want such things to happent to me again. I'm leaving this post to listen to some advice in the meantime before I go to TAFEP hopefully tomorrow or on Wednesday.

t3_1cas2qd,"Do healthcare workers in healthcare, social service sectors get the option to WFH too? Possible suggestions?","I wonder if healthcare workers will benefit from the recent WFH policy that has been announced? I am referring to healthcare workers, including medical professionals, allied health professionals. This can include doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech therapists, social workers, dietitians etc. across various sectors like restructured hospitals, community hospitals, social service agencies (rehabilitation centres, nursing homes, day care centres, special needs schools, early intervention centres). This list is non-exhaustive. According to the CNA article published on 17 April, But if the flexible work arrangement negatively impacts the business, that would be an acceptable reason to reject the request. Some hospitals and organisations are facing a lack of manpower. I will not elaborate on how or why this is happening, based on anecdotes, there are many factors, not limited to burn out, poor pay (that does not justify the workload), poor progression, lack of flexibility and more. With inflation and everything getting more expensive, this sometimes create additional stress and financial burden. Some organisations have always been lacking manpower due to high attrition rates; will this then become a reason for rejection? I understand that the roles of healthcare workers predominantly involve face-to-face physical interaction with patients/clients. However, I believe WFH arrangements can still be explored for healthcare workers to promote work-life balance, prevent burnout, which can possibly lead to better retention rates in the long run. Healthcare workers strive to be there to serve and help their patients/clients. Notwithstanding this, the WFH policy can be extended to healthcare workers. I understand that healthcare workers have to be accountable to their patients/clients. As such, I believe the following measures or points can be considered to still allow healthcare workers across various sectors to continue WFH:It is possible for healthcare professionals to perform their work remotely to a certain extent without being physically present. Doctors and some allied health professionals can provide services remotely by doing teleconsultations. There are telemedicine services in place, for example, teleconsultations provided by SingHealth polyclinics and NUHS, telemedicine mobile applications like Speedoc, WhiteCoat, virtual wards at SGH where ""doctors, nurses, pharmacists and therapists care for patients with a combination of teleconsultations and home visits (quote from SGH's website), some private physiotherapy clinics provide telehealth services too. It seems possible for medical professionals and allied health professionals to support patients remotely as well.Besides seeing patients/clients, I believe some professionals have a lot of administrative workload and preparation work to do before or after seeing their patients/clients. Are they then allowed to do it during WFH days? Some medical and allied health professionals have to constantly keep up with latest research publications to perform evidence based practices. With the workload during the day, some have to sacrifice their after work hours and weekends to catch up on this. Can such administrative tasks be done during WFH days?It would be a significant step to allow healthcare workers to adopt a hybrid work model. We definitely need healthcare workers to be physically present as well. Hence I was thinking a hybrid model may be feasible. For example, to allow employees to WFH for X out of 5 days in a week. If deemed that this will affect the provision of face-to-face services, I suggest having a roster, for example allowing employee A to WFH for X out of 5 days during the 1st and 3rd week of the month. Employee B does so on the 2nd and 4th week of the month. If there is a 5th week in the month, the employees may discuss, come to a consensus to take turns to WFH as needed. By having a roster between weeks, this may ensure that there is still a minimum number of healthcare workers on the ground to serve patients face-to-face. Even with the alternate week hybrid work model, it will still be a significant milestone for healthcare workers across various sectors. I believe this will improve work life balance, promote better mental well being. In the long run, this will help retain employees, minimise attrition, prevent the vicious cycle of employees leaving due to burnout, poor work life balance. I am interested to see how the ministry or relevant agencies can work on this to support this group of professionals. Please note that the above are my opinions and humble suggestions.

t3_1cax9w3,I genuinely hope the tragic Tampines crash will force a safer redesign of Singapore roads,"After reading about it, and seeing the dash cam footage, I had trouble falling asleep last night. The footage was raw and traumatic and to know that within that few frames, 2 people have died, was very disturbing. It was such fucking senseless violence, and because of the egos and recklessness of a couple of assholes, innocent lives are lost. Im not going to call it an accident. Traffic safety advocates discourage the phrase traffic accident. You can read about it [here]( but the TLDR is that these crashes are not inevitable, they are preventable with safer road design. Just a few months ago, [a 4 year old girl was killed in River Valley along a road where drivers commonly speed]( And there is no shortage of many more crashes with cyclists, pedestrians, other road users, skids, etc.It is no surprise to anyone that speeding kills. And our laws against driving infractions are way too lax, yes. But thats a separate topic for another discussion, however valid and warranted it may be.The probability of serious injury and death increases exponentially with vehicular speed. A car driving at double the speed has 4x the amount of kinetic energy. Speeding increases both the frequency and severity of crashes. As much as punishment feels right and just, we need to redesign our roads to prevent speeding in the first place. It is well established that the majority of drivers dont drive at the posted speed limit, they drive at a speed that feels comfortable given the driving conditions of the environment. And a lot of Singapores roads are designed to be straight and wide to optimize for vehicular flow. The old thinking was that you can reduce crashes by making driving easier - but studies after studies have shown this is not the case, because the safer it feels, the faster drivers drive, and the deadlier the outcomes. So road design that tells you to go fast, coupled with spotty enforcement, is just going to result in lots of speeding.In Netherlands, they pioneered a new road design known as [naked streets]( where all hard safety measures are removed in residential streets. It reduced congestion, decreased crashes, and had the side benefit of increased traffic flow. That concept has been successfully applied around the world too.Im not suggesting replacing every street with that. Clearly there are other considerations at play, and other road designs. Im not a traffic engineer or urban planner. But the status quo of wide roads, fast cars, and preventable crashes is clearly untenable. LTA needs to seriously reevaluate current road design and adopt best practices from globally leading cities in this area. I read/watched somewhere that our straight wide road designs were a page out of the USs road design playbook - if this is true, its a nasty path to tread down, because US cities are some of the worst in road safety among developed nations.Credit where it is due - the Silver Zone neighborhoods that LTA is pioneering are pretty pleasant. But that should be the default, not only in specially designated areas. Even the so called car-lite Tengah is terribly car-centric.Honestly, I dont know what we can do as individuals. Ive written in to LTA but I dont know how seriously they take it. I just wanted to get this off my chest because each additional senseless loss of life is one too much.",Infrastructure,-0.95,0.97,0.95,0.9155,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1cax9w3/i_genuinely_hope_the_tragic_tampines_crash_will/,Reddit,23/4/2024 6:02

t3_1cbdjnp,Why are we so mad at the white Mercedes?,"The horrific accident at Tampines that claimed 2 lives has shaken all of us, and also polarised opinion on how much blame (moral rather than legal, probably) should be laid at the door of the driver of the white Mercedes. The views are as diverse as they are many, shading from ""white as snow"" to ""black as the Saab"". There's no doubting though, that there's a lot of hate directed at the white Merc. Why?Now I'm one of those who found themselves getting angrier and angrier at the white Merc the more I watched the videos, and the driver's alleged justifications of their actions didn't help. I have no skin in the game (other than as a longtime driver who would definitely benefit from greater road courtesy and safety like any other driver), though without a doubt the deaths of two innocents weigh heavy, as they should. At least one redditor has pointed out: why are so many of us angrier with the white Merc than the black Saab, and the question has stuck with me, and made me wonder. I'll try to articulate my thoughts as best as I can. Before anything else though, **I wish to make clear that nothing here is intended to justify what the black Saab did. The driver was full on reckless and irresponsible and honestly downright homicidal. They deserve whatever the law metes out to them, maybe even more.** But the question remains: why are we so mad at the white Merc?**Calculated assholery**We all have met people like that. The class bully who pokes and prods the boy with known anger management issues until he snaps and reacts disproportionately. The boy is punished, and the bully walks away with an air of bewildered innocence: ""I was just joking sia. Why he act so crazy?""They are the assholes who know how to stay behind the line of lawfulness. They are not stupid enough to do anything illegal, but that, in a way, only makes them all the more hateful, because they are never punished. Many of them don't even think they are in the wrong. They cling hard to technicalities - they are technically in the right, and don't they know it!The white Merc had the right of way. It was not obliged to give way. It could speed up and slow down as it pleased, right? It's too bad that someone else wanted to overtake - I just happened to speed up what. No lah, I wanted to tell him to slow down (the sheer audacity and absurdity of this one). I'm not wrong what. Tell me which rule I broke, you tell me lah. It's all calibrated. It's all plausible deniability. Maybe you're not wrong, but you sure are an asshole. And in this case, this assholery may have (indirectly) led to the loss of two innocent lives (not to mention the motorcyclist in the right lane who may very well have been mowed down by the Saab). Which leads me to my next point.**They are part of the problem**I think we can agree that Singapore's roads could definitely be safer. First to go should be the drivers like the black Saab (and all the other egregious bad actors, like drunk drivers and reckless speedsters). Second, I would think, are drivers like the white Merc. Safety is always about failsafes. As much as I would wish for there never to be another driver like the black Saab, they will always be around unfortunately. We can probably never fully fathom their motivations or designs. Perhaps we can just write them off as evil or crazy. It falls upon us other drivers, the hopefully rational ones, to behave in a way that will not worsen the problem. This means slowing down when there is someone hellbent on shoving themselves into your lane, come what may. Or at least it means NOT SPEEDING UP. This means not insisting on your right of way when safety and lives hang in the balance. I am fairly sure of one point. Singapore's roads can never be safe if opprobrium is not heaped on drivers like the white Merc. They are part of the problem, even if they are not the biggest culprit. So in short (**TL;DR**), why are we mad at the white Merc? Because unlike the black Saab they will probably get away scot-free (or close to it), and their continued misbehaviour means Singapore's roads will never be safe.",Public Safety,-0.9,0.95,0.9,-0.997,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1cbdjnp/why_are_we_so_mad_at_the_white_mercedes/,Reddit,23/4/2024 19:30

Most of my driving experience is not in SG, but in a foreign country where I currently reside. However, there are a couple of times I went back to SG, drove on the roads, and all I can say is that its terrifying and nerve-wrecking. The chaotic flow of traffic, the numerous cars breathing behind you ready to overtake you anytime they can, people blocking you from lane changing, and often the lack of courtesy is more than enough to give me anxiety on the roads in SG. My recent exp: I got horned for allowing someone to come into my lane so they can make a right turn.Compared to where I am, people on the roads are more forgiving. Many times, stopping and allowing for cars to make a turn out of a side road into a busy main road, slower cars stopping by the side of the road to allow for others to overtake them safely, or even slowing down to allow others to filter into their lane. Of course, there are always bad eggs, but its really rare. And because of this, I feel that Singaporeans can afford to give a little more courtesy on the roads. It could be because Singaporeans are more kanjiong, or some other reason that I don't know about, and of course its not perfect anywhere. So for those currently driving in SG, I'd really like to know your thoughts on this.What are your general feelings/ thoughts about driving or the roads in SG?What do you think can change for the better, or what do you want to change for the better?Disclaimer: I do not think that Singapore is bad or that the country I'm at is better or anything.

t3_1cgvns7,Why singapore produces no athletes?,"Age old question, why is it that singapore cannot produce anyone to perform on the world stage? I think I actually might have the answer. It comes down entirely to having zero career opportunities and prize money in the early careers of sportsmans here.We could talk about all sorts of sports but the one that I want to specifically highlight is bowling. This is a sport that is essentially open to all ages, young or old, all the equipment is the same around the world and playing a 6 game 240 average isn't a inferior in any way. What I realize watching the PBA Jr Nationals is that even at 16/17 years old, these teens are able to earn enough money through competing that is roughly equivalent to a regular teen working full time at your usual part time jobs. And once they pass 18, they can compete in regionals that earn $25,000 as first place and with some of the youngest bowlers only at 20 bowling at PBA open championships with first place earning $100,000. Even at second or 3rd place, the prize money is basically equivalent to 1 year salary of your fresh grad poly. And I think that's the issue singapore has, which is that any kid here can compete and perform crazy good but there is literally no way to make even a part time living doing the sport past the age of 16/18. There is literally no way for some 18 year old to keep practicing hard at their sport that they have been playing since primary school. Because there is not even any money in it. I was bowling extremely competitively in secondary school, but after I graduated, I had nothing else to back me up, and I gave up the sport. And every time I see some 14,15 year old kid scoring well above 200, I always wonder, what's going to happen to them when they graduate? End up playing league?If we see places like the olympics is basically the high point of the career, what is the entry point? That is what singapore is desperately missing. Just think about it, as a uni student, if you spend 20 hours a week practicing your sport, you could essentially win enough money to last you your entire degree or even pay off your degree and it's a sport you've been doing all your life and you are clearly top of your game. And if you continue to practice, you can earn enough money to essentially play the sport full time.We don't even need that many competitions, we just need a handful enough a year that teens at the top of the level can continue to compete at after secondary school and make enough money like part time job. Because honestly when you try to compete on the level like commonwealth games 2024 is like asking a entry level worker to be on the same level as people with several years experience. So when we ask why aren't there any top level athletes in singapore, we have to ask, what's an 18 year old teen to do capitalise and earn money on his skill in a sport?",Employment,-0.7,0.85,0.8,0.9931,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1cgvns7/why_singapore_produces_no_athletes/,Reddit,30/4/2024 15:28
t3_1chcj39,Poorly designed modern buses in Singapore by policymakers / designers who have lost touch with the ground?,"Who designed this awkward seat design on new buses?The seats on the new buses are greatly reduced because someone decided to change the bus designs, changing the seats to face each other. As you can see the space between the seats previously fit additional seats. Now commuters have to face each other in an awkward way, with legs touching each other on the bus??? Many commuters now dont have seats to sit too because passengers often stretch out their legs making it super inconvenient to sit opposite them. People have to sit at an angle just to avoid touching each other (if they even bother to sit). People who sit facing the rear also have greater difficulty seeing where the bus is heading to and when they need to alight, or suffer from motion sickness. As a result the seats facing the rear are often unoccupied. What a waste of space and unnecessary change. Its like whoever designed these doesnt even take the bus? These seats were probably designed for families but how often do you see a family needing to sit like this? Is the change even necessary? Furthermore, as a result of this change, the seats at the front are bunched up as well. Ive tried seating just in front of these seats and my feet couldnt fit into the space.

t3_1cvmmgv,Singapore condo pricing is becoming more determined by market sentiment than actual buyer needs.,"From my personal observations, I have noticed that in recent years, the price of condos has become based less on what condo buyers actually want or need and more on what everyone thinks other buyers want which tbh to me feels completely off kilter. To elaborate, I noticed lately there are certain things that many people look out for in condos that will give it unreasonable premiums. Things such as proximity to good schools, having certain facilities like tennis courts, etc. For one, the number of school children has been dropping each year, I just find it difficult to understand why the premium for housing near good schools (sorry all schools are good schools okay?) is increasing so much each passing year. And then facilities like tennis court -- are they really so important as to push up the price so much compared to one nearby without? Almost no one I talk to living in condo really care about it or even utilise it but they say they look out for some of these factors because it makes it easier to sell at higher price in the future. Also some things like larger but fewer bedrooms are cast aside in favour of more but much smaller bedrooms. Even developers are taking cue and building more and more of such tiny bedroom condos cramming as many bedrooms as they can into 800 sq ft spaces. Who the heck chooses to live like that and why do they command a premium? Each room feels like a capsule in a capsule hotel.Which brings me to the next point. People nowadays keep talking about buying housing with an ""exit strategy"" macam it's an investment. Maybe there's nothing wrong with treating it as some kind of investment but it seems nowadays, a condo's intrinsic value as a shelter is lower than it's value as a speculation vehicle where everyone seem to have agreed that a condo needs to have x,y,z in order for it to have ""good"" value even though they don't really want x,y,z themselves personally. Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be any arbitrage mechanism and this trend seems to continue into the foreseeable future.",Economy,-0.8,0.9,0.8,0.9906,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1cvmmgv/singapore_condo_pricing_is_becoming_more/,Reddit,19/5/2024 11:58

t3_1cxvyod,"got racially harassed at a bus stop, no one stood up for me","*NOT my own post, re-posting for a friend who does not have enough karma to post on this subreddit* im a singaporean indian in my 20s who has lived in singapore my whole life. just like many other brown people in sg, ive experienced people casually throwing around racist remarks - but mostly brush it off bcos that is the reality of being a minority. but today for the first time, there was a man who was blatantly racist and threatening me to my face. it was bad, but what was worse is the fact that no one stood up for me. i was rushing to the bus stop because i thought my bus reached but i realised it wasnt my bus so i stopped and started using my phone. there was this old chinese man standing beside me with this 15ish year old boy who looked like he had some sort of developmental delay / special needs. the man kept muttering under his breath and swinging his cane around. at first, i ignored it but then i started listening bcos he kept looking at me. he kept saying stuff abt ppl rushing and cutting queue and looking at me. im 90% sure i didnt bang into him cos i didnt feel any impact. but maybe me rushing startled him or maybe i was unaware of my surroundings while i was using my phone - ok im willing to accept that it was my fault if i did do anything to invade his personal space. then he started sounding angrier and swinging his cane more so i just asked him excuse me, are you talking to me? he started going on and on saying u people always rushing, u indians are all like this. i just said what do you think youre saying bcos i was naturally getting angry. he started going on this whole rant abt i dont have a problem with you, i have a problem with ur ancestors, all u indians blablabla at this point i dont even know what he exactly he was saying but it was definitely some massively racist rant. i was just in shock bcos this was the first time someone was openly saying these kind of remarks right to my face. i got really angry but i was also very scared - my heart was pounding because he kept swinging his cane and saying things like ill hit all u indians if u do this to me. now i wish i had taken a video but at that moment i was genuinely frozen because i was so upset. i just said mind your language but he kept going and on. he started saying stuff like u can call 999 if u want i wont stop. then he pointed to another indian man standing behind me and started ranting at him too. at some point, i just put my airpods in and stood away from him because he was clearly unstable. his bus came and a bunch of migrant workers were getting out of the bus and he swung his cane at them - to me, it looked like he was trying to hit them. the teenage boy with him also shoved his shoulder into the workers. he was a scrawny little boy so if they wanted to, the migrant workers could have definitely pushed him away but they just looked at him with confusion. thinking about it now, this old man definitely shares these racist remarks with the boy and encourages him to think the same way & be violent towards indians - it is so upsetting that hes corrupting a special needs boy like this. this whole incident only lasted 3-4 mins & i know he wasnt violent towards me & it wasnt that terrible. but the shock of the situation got to me because this happened right in my own neighbourhood, the same place ive lived in the last 21 years. i was angry and upset with myself that i didnt say anything more to him and that i didnt confront him. at this point, i was trembling and i started crying at the bus stop. the worst part of this incident was that no one in the bus stop even stepped in to say anything when that man was straight up threatening us. it was only me responding to him. im not sure if he was already muttering these things before i came to the bus stop. ok fine, i can understand if you dont want to confront an angry man. but afterwards i was literally shaking and sniffling and not a single person said anything to me. how hard is it to say a comforting word? it was a crowded bus stop some more with so many people.and out of all these ppl, you mean only a young girl would dare to say anything? i really wanted to stop crying but i was so embarrassed and that just made me feel worse. i boarded the bus and on the bus i was crying even more. i honestly dont know why i was crying so much, i think i was just really overwhelmed. there were ppl who were at that bus stop who saw what happened and got on the bus w me. but typical singaporeans ofcourse they didnt say anything except stare at me even though i had tears rolling down my face. more than the man himself, i was mad at the bystanders of the bus stop for not saying anything. singaporeans love to throw arnd terms like kampung spirit but lets be real, it barely exists these days. im sure people there knew what was happening was wrong but theres 0 community spirit, theres 0 willingness to help others. its so, so disappointing. my friends suggested that i should lodge an online police report even though it's unlikely that there will be any action against him as it's still considered a very minor incident. at least it will be on his record if he repeats this behaviour? i don't know what i should do, i'm not sure if it's worth the hassle. i used to be alot more passionate abt talking abt the prevalence of racism in sg when i was younger but as i got older, it just feels futile. if u want to understand, sure. but if u don't want to, i'm not gna waste my energy forcing u to understand. in my opinion, not enough people speak up about this because no one wants to be immediately classified as a ""wokeist"" or ""sjw"" what's the point. im tired of this",Public Safety,-0.9,0.95,0.9,-0.9988,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1cxvyod/got_racially_harassed_at_a_bus_stop_no_one_stood/,Reddit,22/5/2024 9:17

(We have currently 40 (+1?), we used to have hundreds, rip the Mercedes 0405 bendies)Articulated buses were phased out to free space to park an expanding bus fleet. From our understanding, the articulated buses take up more space at bus stops. In addition, double decker buses provide bus capacity in a more cost-efficient manner than articulated buses. (Probably in response to my qns that we have the resources and space by SMRT to maintain and store bendies b4 BCM and LTA takeover)Once again, thank you for wrting to us and giving us the opportunity to clarify further.By the way, this was an email that dragged on a bit longer than usual, they emailed me saying they needed more time to gather info. I did also asked for the stats on electric buses, but dk is it ignore or still generating answer.Personal thoughts: Initially it makes sense, but I would still argue the need to have articulated buses in SG may have decreased but not zero. There are cases where double decker buses are nor efficient in certain areas. E.g. I remembered there was always a problem for buses like 179/196 where students would crowd in the area between the standing area and staircase to 2nd floor, so the bus driver has to shout at those to move back, students probably have the thought because their school is nearby, just camp the exit. Having articulated buses allows for better exit flow, incentives people to move back. B4 yall say 3 door DD buses, the 3rd door is kinda awkward, with the step and all, hence I still think we need proper three door bendies.Moving on, with the article where some elderly fell from climbing the stairs claiming they strong enough to climb, wouldn't having articulated buses half solve the problem, increased capacity but no stairs climbing so no falling risk. E.g. 302, I remember it plys CCK which quite a few Elderlies, bendy buses were OK then, so what is the issue now?I also stated areas like Changi Airport with its low ceiling requires single decker buses, so bendies would still work, can be seen now on 858. I understand the routes can be limited, SBS had bad exp with a 14.5m long rigid body Volvo B10M, hence swearing to have buses no longer than 12m.

t3_1da2kig,The feasibility of Singapore football.,"Lets be honest. Singapore will never ever make it into the World Cup, let alone advancing, not even winning, the Asian Cup. Regardless of how the performance at the game last night, football is just not sustainable nor feasible in the long run.It boils down to a few things.Let's talk about genetics and lifestyle. I recently came back from a trip to South Korea. What I noticed is that guys there are bigger and fitter. The typical Korean diet involves a lot of meat (pork, beef). Their environment, even in Seoul, are mostly manual. They rely on stairs ALOT. I've even seen an old man, probably in his 80s, 90s, pushing a heavy metal cart loaded with stuff up a steep hill to his residence. The environment played a big part in natural shaping their people. Makes you wonder how the Singaporean lifestyle is so lacking in terms of that.Our homegrown league, S-League, or laughably known as ""Singapore PREMIER League"", is a SEMI-PROFESSIONAL football league. Training levels, methodologies, upbringing, talent development programmes are different by massive levels. Japan, Korea, Saudi, China (to some extent), Australia have players that plays professionally across Europe. Right back at home, they have proper professional football leagues helping to develop and grow talents. And when we talk about proper professional football leagues, we are talking about one that is highly competitive with multi-tier promotion and relegation system.In Europe, footballers are trained as young as 5 years old. Upon reaching the age of 15, 16, they have to decide if they want to do it professionally, because that means giving up on academia pursuits and focusing solely on athletic development. Football is not just a sport, but a lucrative industry in these countries. English Premier League alone, is a key significant contributor to England's GDP with excess of Billions coming in and out of the competition.To sum up, here at home, we don't have the environment, the genetics, the resources nor commercial viability to grow football into an industry and into a viable professional career path. Some people blamed the FAS, but honestly, with these inherent factors already being an unmovable stumbling block, there's nothing anyone can realistically do about it. Our govt is not completely oblivious to this fact.If we can't grow our own talents at home, sure...send them abroad, BUT we have our staunch NS liabilities that, OBVIOUSLY, is hindering sports development. Son Heung Min, Park Ji Sung, Nemanja Vidic, just to name a few, are completely exempted from their NS liabilities in their respective countries.To put it bluntly, govt is naively trying to have everything in balance, but no, just like professional football development programmes in Europe, you can't. You can't have everything all at once.In the 90s, govt say let's do it for World Cup by 2010...then quietly scrap that and say 2020...now say 2034. Let's be honest, the way things are, we WILL NEVER get there. Some might say ""its not always about winning, atleast we try"".

t3_1dilfrh,Why are some bosses so against promoting work life balance and giving flexi-work arrangements? A mini rant.,"I work in a social service agency. Some time back, a new staff joined the upper management. He was really enthusiastic and keen on promoting work life balance and providing employees flexi-work arrangements and has proposed small changes.The employees on the ground are happy that we have someone in the upper management who cares for our well-being and is taking proactive steps to enhance job satisfaction. Hes different, unlike the other staff in the upper management. But one man can be pushing for the changes and flexi-work arrangements alone, especially since hes new to the organisation too.It seems that the other staff in the upper management does not fully support what this new boss is doing. I can sense some awkwardness and tension between the new boss and the other bosses.For context, my organisation is known for having lower salaries compared to organisations of similar nature, and have high attrition rates in recent years. All these have repeatedly been highlighted on Glassdoor reviews too. A survey conducted recently by one of the bosses show that theres poor job satisfaction amongst the employees. We are suffering from a severe lack of manpower and there are not enough new hires to cover the gaps. As a result, current staff are burdened with more workload. Im thankful that this new boss cares for our well being. Working in this SSA isnt easy, some of us have to deal with challenging and complex clients which can take a toll on our physical and/or mental well being. Unfortunately for flexi work arrangements to actualise, I guess the majority in the upper management has to be in consensus too. One man cant change the entire system that has been plagued for years. To be honest, I think the organisation needs a complete change of upper management and only keep the new staff and hire new capable staff or second staff from other organisations, to salvage the low morale and high turnover rate in the organisation. I dont understand why cant the upper management be open to changes. Wouldnt the flexi work arrangements benefit themselves too? The organisation cant just be thinking about serving the clients and promoting inclusivity, neglecting the employees.",Employment,-0.9,0.95,0.8,0.9208,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1dilfrh/why_are_some_bosses_so_against_promoting_work/,Reddit,18/6/2024 8:11

t3_1dqbod1,A alternative to explore to curb the pigeon problem we are facing.,"The pigeon population in Singapore is getting out of control.They poop everywhere, make disgusting messes and our town councils decide to cull them to reduce their population.However, pigeon culling is only a temporary measure, and a counterproductive one at that. Culling pigeons creates a food territory vacuum that enables other pests such as mynahs, crows and rats to flood in to get access to the now available food that the culled pigeons had been taking. Moreover, thinning out a pigeon population suddenly in this way encourages the immigration of pigeons from other towns. Less competition from the now dead pigeons, empty HDB nests (more BTO opening for pigeons!) and now abundant food supply in food courts and coffeeshops effectively improves the fertility rate of the new pigeon residents. A well documented example of this comes from Basel, Switzerland, which had a pigeon population of approximately 20,000. From 1961 to 1985, the city killed around 100,000 pigeons each year, but the population remained stable.I have done a little research on how to manage the population of pigeons in Singapore and found that cities in Germany (using the Augsburg model) are able to keep pigeons off their streets successfully. Their answer is to build and maintain pigeon lofts (dovecotes). Dovecotes house city pigeons, providing them safety, abundant food and shelter. With ready access to healthy food specially prepared for these pigeons, the pigeons never found the need to leave the dovecotes and spend most of their time inside, only venturing out to fly and stretch their wings. The specially prepared food also ensures that the pigeons have a minimum exposure to harmful parasites and diseases from the environment. This prevents them from becoming a vector for disease and parasites.Pigeons were bred by humans to mate and produce offspring all year round. This trait was to provide food and eggs to humans until we bred chickens to do it more effectively. As such, to control the population, pigeon eggs are replaced with fake eggs that pigeons think are real but do not hatch.The Germans came up with a document in September 2021 to manage the population of city pigeons effectively using the ""Augsburg model"". This model is currently being used in the following cities/towns:-Baden-Wuerttemberg: Aalen, Balingen, Esslingen, Karlsruhe, Mannheim, Metzingen, Pforzheim, Reutlingen, Rottenburg, Rottweil, Schorndorf, Schwbisch Gmnd, TbingenBavaria: Aichach, Augsburg, Bad Kissingen Erlangen, WrzburgHesse: Frankfurt, Kassel, WiesbadenLower Saxony: Gttingen, HanoverNorth Rhine-Westphalia: Aachen, Bielefeld, Dsseldorf, Essen, Moers, Witten, WlfrathRhineland-Palatinate: Bad Kreuznach, LudwigshafenSaarland: Homburg, SaarbrckenSaxony: TorgauIt is a PDF, and you can find it by Googling ""eurogroup management of city pigeons"". This document details information such as:-- cost breakdown,- requirements for a successful implementation, - considerations when maintaining the cleanliness,- health of the pigeons, and - a checklist to establish a supervised dovecote. The document also details possible issues a city might encounter when attempting to implement the dovecote and suggestions for possible solutions to such issues. However, it is explicitly noted that the solution to each of the problems mentioned can have a different weight, and these problems are often very city-specific, hence, the manual should only serve as a guideline to check against for effectiveness. I believe that with effective management, our Town Councils can work together with SPCA, NParks, URA and HDB to build on and improve on this model to curb Singapore's pigeon problem.Instead of culling pigeons with poison and risk the health of our wildlife and neighborhood strays, we need to explore other options that actually work and is an effective use of our taxpayers money.",Environment,-0.8,0.95,0.7,0.9577,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1dqbod1/a_alternative_to_explore_to_curb_the_pigeon/,Reddit,28/6/2024 5:01

t3_1du09b3,Forum: Look into fairness of selection process for student athletes,"The allure of securing a spot in a prestigious secondary school via the Direct School Admission (DSA) scheme drives many parents to seek specialised coaching for their children.While supporting ones children is understandable, the influx of money into talent development programmes has given rise to conflicts of interest and moral hazards.Many school team coaches are gatekeepers, deciding who gets into the school team and who goes for competitions. They often run external classes for the same activity, which are offered to aspiring school representatives for a fee.This creates a financial incentive to favour students from their own courses, giving them an unfair advantage and undermining the integrity of the selection process.The situation is exacerbated in certain DSA subjects by the dominance of a few coaches.To ensure sufficient rotation and to prevent the entrenchment of interests, schools should set tenure limits for external coaches. The school team should be selected by an independent panel of teachers who have no pecuniary interest in the relevant activity. These measures can ensure a more equitable and sustainable system for direct school admissions.

Not for profiteering. Has HDB been sleeping on the job to neglect it's primary duty?1983-1986 units in outskirts are fetching $400-500k, which is an insensible decision to commit half a million since these are 99-years, not freehold.My colleague recently sat me down and advise me to go US for opportunities since I'm unmarried, and cited I might have better chances to meet the right person too. I can't even buy a reasonably priced place in SG, and rent is expensive. BTO is wait long long and paying over $48k in rent (after multiplying $800 mthly rent across the 5-year wait).

t3_1e8ee06,Our racial/religious relations got worse in last few years. How can we improve?,"Today is Racial Harmony Day. 60 years after the racial riots. Singapore come a long way since then but we cannot take racial harmony for granted. Past few years our racial/religious relations got slightly worse. When pandemic started, got a lot of anti-Chinese racism overseas (even some cases in Singapore) + Malaysia political crisis also started. Restrictions (like circuit breaker) cause a lot of economic hardship + social hardship (no Hari Raya visits). Many disadvantaged Singaporean families become reliant on Chinese/Malay-language social media.2021 Delta variant caused a lot of racism against Indians including one violent attack + more restrictions led to more economic/social hardship (Hari Raya kena cancelled again). PSP keep raising CECA issue which spark concerns about racism against Indians. As more Singaporeans get vaccine gahmen introduce SMMs based on vaccine status but got pushback from small groups of anti-vaxxers (mainly Christians influenced by Trump ideology). Many traditional Chinese kena brainwash by China propaganda on Chinese-language social media. 2022 start with Christian teen detained under ISA for plans to attack mosques then start of Russia-Ukraine war. Severe inflation push many disadvantaged Singaporean families to/beyond breaking point. Malay-language social media mood of desperation and insecurity due to economic/social hardship + cases of employment racial discrimination + fear of extremism from Chinese (started with China propaganda but got worse after 377A repeal but many LGBT/supporter indicate want to push for more). This make some receptive to Malaysia propaganda (which Singapore Malay community strongly rejected for decades) spreading during their election.In 2023 inflation remained high. A few incidents involving politicians (mostly minority races) spark some concerns and conspiracy theories. On Racial Harmony Day an Indian policeman commit suicide after making public claims about workplace racism. Then the Hamas attack on Israel sparked a new war in Gaza. By then Malaysia propaganda and even extremist groups learn how to effective exploit the desperation/insecurity/hardship in many low SES Malay Singaporeans.So far 2024 is good with less severe inflation and no new major shocks. Gahmen will allow cats in HDB flats + working out details for workplace anti-discrimination laws (continues their damage control like allowing nurses to wear tudung in 2021 + Tharman winning president election in 2023). Of course still got risk of new major shock in second half of 2024.This Racial Harmony Day I hope our racial harmony will improve and we can do things to protect/improve it.

t3_1ei6oky,"Former NTUC Income CEO and NTUC Enterprise GCEO: I have today written an open letter to MAS Chairman, Mr Gan Kim Yong, asking for government regulators to step in and carefully review the planned sale of a 51% stake in NTUC Income by NTUC Enterprise (NE) and minority shareholders to Allianz.","I have today written an open letter to MAS Chairman, Mr Gan Kim Yong, asking for government regulators to step in and carefully review the planned sale of a 51% stake in NTUC Income by NTUC Enterprise (NE) and minority shareholders to Allianz. In my view, there are 3 key reasons why our regulators should not approve the sale. 1. First, between 2015 and 2020, NE increased its shareholding in NTUC Income from 30% to 70% by merely paying par value ($10 per share), when the true or market value of the shares was much higher. NEs commitment not to redeem the shares was fundamental to NTUC Income allowing NE to obtain shares in NTUC Income at par value. This assurance helped NE increase its shareholding in NTUC Income from 30% to 70%, all at a mere par value of the shares.2. Second, after NE got these substantial shares at par value and diluted minority shareholders, NTUC Income was corporatised but the assurance was given that NE would continue to be majority shareholder. 3. Now, just less than 2 years later, NE is selling those shares to Allianz for a huge profit - with Allianz becoming the majority shareholder. The sale to Allianz will fundamentally erode the social mission of NTUC Income. Allianz is a commercial enterprise focussed on pursuing profit. There is no reason to believe that Allianz will prioritise NTUCs social mission above its own profits. As you can see, this is not merely about the sale of Income to Allianz, or only about the social mission of our cooperatives. At heart, it is about the integrity of commitments given by institutions on which we rely to safeguard our nations economic well-being and citizens interests. Surely, it is right to expect these commitments to be kept. I have spoken up publicly about this issue given my background and familiarity with the issues. As loyal citizens who care for our country, we must speak up on matters of public interest. This promotes accountability and a resilient society.It is in this spirit that I publish this open letter.",Legal,-0.8,0.95,0.9,0.9966,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ei6oky,Reddit,2/8/2024 10:31

t3_1ejdmuq,"Excerpt from ""The Roar of the Lion City: Ethnicity, Gender, and Culture in the Singapore Armed Forces""","As we all know, the expansion of conscription to include women, either in non-combat or combat roles, to solve the manpower issue that the SAF faces is a heavily debated-upon, perhaps even *the* most heavily debated-upon topic in r/sg (it'd be interesting to know what the contenders are!). Today, however, I'd like to share something a little different - below is an excerpt from ""The Roar of the Lion City: Ethnicity, Gender, and Culture in the Singapore Armed Forces"" by Sean P. Walsh, specifically, the section regarding the institutional racism embedded within the SAF, its origins, and its consequences. It's important to note that the piece was written in 2007 - although I do believe it's still highly relevant to the situation today. I do highly recommend reading the work in its entirety. It goes into other aspects of the SAF like the scholar-farmer divide, the training culture, and the role of women. If anyone without institutional access would like to read it, shoot me a DM! I'd also greatly appreciate it if anyone has any recommendations for further reading on the culture of the SAF.>Historically, one of Singapores most pressing concerns has been how to integrate its multiethnic society into a capable and trustworthy military force. Singapores dominant Chinese leadership has responded to this situation by keeping Singapores minority ethnic groups, Indians and Malays, from being integrated fully into the structure of the SAF. Because of the historical legacy of the federation period and Singapores perception of Malaysia as its most likely adversary, Malays particularly are discriminated against. Lip service always has been paid to integrating the military fully as a way to maintain loyalty for the Singapore state. Dr. Goh Kong See, Singapores first minister of defense, endorsed this supposed policy by saying, Nothing creates loyalty and national consciousness more speedily and thoroughly than participation in defense and membership in the armed forces. Reality has failed to live up to this goal, however. At present, official discrimination against the Malay population remains an open secret among the Singaporean military. Although there have been some improvements in recent years, Malays systematically are kept from serving in areas of the military considered sensitive, to include signal, intelligence, and elite-guards units. This exclusion is so extreme that SAF intelligence uses ethnic Chinese trained in Malay as analysts to read Malay newspapers rather than take advantage of their own ethnic Malay soldiers. Also, it was not until 2004 that Singapores first non-Chinese officer reached flag rank. There are a number of reasons for this discrimination against Malays in the SAF. The foremost reason is that Singapores leadership does not trust the almost exclusively Muslim Malay population. The historical legacy of the federation period is still fresh in the minds of most of Singapores leaders. In 1964, the Malay populations resentment of Chinese wealth led to race riots that left 21 dead, 450 injured, and more than 1,700 arrested. Other riots occurred in the years to follow. Although the days of such violence are over in Singapore, there is still significant resentment among many in the Malay population about the obvious ethnic socioeconomic disparity that exists in their country and government policies that restrict religious expression. It is feared that if push came to shove and Singapore was forced to fight against Malaysia, Singapores Malay population would refuse to take up arms for the Lion City. This feeling is only exacerbated by revelations that the attempted terrorist attacks in 2001 were planned by Singapore Malays, several of whom had served in the SAF. More important than the history of poor relations in Singapore between the Malays and Chinese in fostering distrust is the fact that in the minds of Singapores leadership, Malaysia is the Lion Citys primary threat. Although trade and relations between the two states are stable now, Singapores small size and island geography, while making it the perfect entreport into Southeast Asia, makes it particularly vulnerable to an attack from its far larger neighbor. In addition, Singapores fresh water comes almost exclusively from Malaysia, making the possibility of resource blackmail a frightening reality. Singapore also fears that events in Muslim-dominated Malaysia or Indonesia, where relations between the ethnic Chinese and the majority populations are especially tense, will spill over into a conflict with Singapore. For instance, in 1969, race riots between Chinese and Malays in Malaysia spread to Singapore, causing significant turmoil there as well. Singapores leadership also fears that a Malaysian or Indonesian government rocked by economic or political problems could use a strike on Singapore as a way to rally the country and maintain control. The aftermath of the 1999 Asian financial crisis gave credence to this fear. While Singapore emerged relatively unscathed, many of its neighbors were devastated financially, and their leaders attempted to exploit domestic jealousy of the prosperity of Chinesedominated Singapore as a scapegoat for their own domestic problems. In Indonesia, for instance, there were acts of violence against ethnic Chinese, and President B. J. Habibie publicly called the Singapore people and government real racists. This fear of the Muslim Malay population has led to a systematic discrimination in the military by Singapores leadership after 1965. Most of the senior military officers appointed to the SAF immediately after independence came from the civil service and shared the view that the Malay population could not be trusted. At the time, however, Malays made up the vast majority of both the Singaporean military and police force. Yet, the new, postindependence SAF leadership, though possessing minimal martial experience, proceeded to exclude the Malay population forcibly from the military. Recruitment of Singaporean Malays virtually was halted after 1967, despite the fact that Malays made up 50 to 80 percent of the first cohort of volunteers for the new armed force. Experienced Malay officers and noncommissioned officers were transferred from field commands to logistics and support, while many others were forced to retire or were shut off from promotion. Prime Minister Lee Kwan Yew and the rest of the Chinese leadership feared that the Malay population would surrender in a conflict with Malaysia so much that they sacrificed virtually all of the experience and professionalism that had been built up before 1965 in exchange for a Chinese-dominated military. Although declining birth rates have forced Singapore to accept an increasingly larger role for the Malay population in its military, the effects of the systematic exclusion of the first years after independence still are felt today. Singapores policy of preventing full integration of minorities into the SAF has two major consequences. First, it limits the involvement of the ethnic group most inclined to join the military. This creates serious challenges for the ability of the state to field the force it needs to meet its domestic security needs as well as conduct peacekeeping and humanitarian operations abroad. Second, the discrimination of Singaporean Malays in the military contributes to a continued perception of second-class status among the ethnic Malay population, a fact of which terrorist recruiters have taken advantage before, and they may do so again. As discussed earlier, Singapore must expend considerable effort in overcoming the cultural factors discouraging ethnic Chinese from joining the military, yet it fails to fully use the Malay population that culturally looks highly on military service. This is evidenced by the composition of Singapores armed forces before independence. The local military and police force that Singapore inherited from the United Kingdom was almost exclusively Malay. In 1965, seven-eighths of Singapores police were Malaysian. By the mid-1970s, however, Malaysians had become, in the words of Harvard researcher Alon Peled, exasperated for not being called to serve because of the exclusionary policies of the SAF leadership. The SAF exclusion also reinforces the feeling that Malays cannot be trusted. By denying them the chance to serve in all capacities of the military, Singapore simply is entrenching the belief that Malays are inherently disloyal. Singapores leadership has said that Malays can be better integrated into the armed forces only when they have been integrated more fully into Singaporean society. Yet, the SAFs systematic discrimination and obvious distrust of the Malay population is a major reason Malays are unable to become full members of Singaporean society, which in turn is claimed as the reason why they are not allowed full participation in the military. Singaporean leadership, to include former prime minister Lee Kwan Yew, has dismissed this perspective, denying that this chicken-and-the-egg problem even exists. The SAFs discrimination and distrust of its Malay soldiers certainly contributes to any sense of alienation that is felt among the Singaporean Malay population. Although large-scale protest is difficult in Singapore because of tight social controls, there is obvious discontent among the Malay population regarding its second-class status. Perhaps most disturbingly, the planned terrorist attacks discovered in 2001 show that terrorist groups such as Al-Qaeda and Jemiah Islamiyah see Singapore as a potential target and wish to recruit Singaporean Malays to participate in their operations. Such terrorist groups could take advantage of the discrimination and feelings of alienation that many Malays feel for being restricted from many roles in the military. Benefits of Integration Singapore could benefit immensely from the full use of the large non-Chinese segment of its population that sees military service as a favorable profession. By working toward full integration, Singapore could build a more professional military more easily with large numbers of Malay commissioned and noncommissioned officers who more willingly will stay in the military longer. Rather than relying on educational opportunities as a primary tool for promotion and retention, an SAF that features a large Malay population that joins the military out of a desire for service likely could make experience the primary requirement for promotion. In addition, fielding a more diverse force could make the SAF more effective in those peacekeeping and humanitarian operations that involve Singapores neighbors and in which the Chinese in Singapore are often looked at with jealousy and resentment. Also, if the SAF had more high-profile minority senior officers, it potentially could go a long way in dissuading its neighbors from viewing Singapore with such jealousy and anger. For instance, as previously stated, following the 1999 Asian financial crisis, during a time of extremely high tension between Singapore and its neighbors, Indonesian president B. J. Habibie called Singaporeans racists and specifically criticized the discriminatory policies in the SAF by saying, In Singapore, if you are Malay, you can never make a military officer. The presence of high profile Malaysian senior officers in the SAF certainly would lessen the threat of a neighboring and potentially hostile states characterizing Singapore as an aggressive Chinese-dominated state to divert attention away from domestic problems. It is likely that such officers also could help to diffuse regional tensions by playing an active role in military-to-military contact with Singapores neighbors. Such contact could include combined training and officer exchanges. Perhaps most importantly, ending the discriminatory policies in the SAF would have the effect that Singapores government long has claimed that National Service is meant to achieve: Apart from fulfilling military requirements, National Service has the wider objective of integrating a multi-ethnic, multi-lingual and multi-religious community committed to Singapore and the well being of its citizens. Ideally, by bringing together individuals from all strata of society and giving them a common experience, conscription breaks down barriers and serves as a force of acculturation and the creation of a more closely knit society. Yet, under current policies, conscription in Singapore fails to achieve this goal fully. Full integration of the SAF, that is to say, participation of Malays in all branches of service beyond mere token representation and the removal of glass ceilings to promotion and assignments, greatly would help to incorporate the Malay population more fully into Singaporean society and reinforce its commitment to the Singapore Armed Forces. Studies have shown that integrated military service has a lasting positive impact on acculturation and cross-cultural learning. However, the policies of official discrimination of minorities in the SAF prevent any such cross-cultural learning from producing lasting structural and attitudinal changes. By denying Malays the opportunity to participate fully in all branches of the military and by placing glass ceilings to their promotion, members of the armed forces that serve in these capacities and at the SAFs upper levels lose the benefits of cross-cultural learning that come with shared military service. For instance, the special scholar platoons in basic training, composed of scholarship winners, are usually almost entirely Chinese, and therefore, scholar officers work very little with Malay soldiers even during BMT. Because high-ranking officers are often incredibly influential in determining Singapores policies after their military career is over, the fact that they do not gain many of the benefits of cross-cultural learning that are a part of fully integrated military service is especially significant. If these officers have not served with Malays in any meaningful capacity during their military careers, it only can be expected that the policies of distrust will continue until Malays are given the chance to prove themselves in sensitive areas and positions of high rank.",Politics,-0.9,0.95,0.9,-0.9969,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1ejdmuq/excerpt_from_the_roar_of_the_lion_city_ethnicity/,Reddit,3/8/2024 20:51

The NTUC Joint Statement claims that the arguments in my first open letter are not well founded and unfair. I disagree. With respect, it is the NTUC Joint Statement that has got some key points fundamentally wrong. In my first MAS letter, I said that in receiving the 63 million extra shares at par value in NTUC Income (Income), NTUC Enterprise (NE) had committed not to redeem those shares in perpetuity. I also said that this commitment was fundamental to Income allowing NE to obtain the 63 million shares at par value (and not at the true value of the shares). The NTUC Joint Statement asserts that NEs undertaking was not for an indefinite period. NTUC is seriously mistaken. I was the Group CEO of NE at the time. I recall clearly there were multiple meetings and discussions both at the NE and Income boards where this commitment was given by NE. Consistent with this undertaking, these shares were later converted into irredeemable shares. Full details are given in my second letter to the MAS. I have invited the MAS to ask both NE and Income to produce all the relevant board minutes and papers covering the discussions on the undertaking that was given by NE. MAS and the public can then judge the matter for themselves. 63 million Income shares were issued to NE at par upon that undertaking. When institutions give undertakings and assurances, both the letter and spirit of those undertakings and assurances must be honoured.If this sale goes through, NE as minority shareholder will have no power to ensure that Allianz, a for-profit corporation, will subordinate its own profit-making objectives to further NTUCs social mission. The NTUC Joint Statement has not shown that Allianz has given a legally binding commitment to make NTUCs social mission paramount over its own profits.Respectfully, the NTUC Joint Statement misses the woods for the trees.I sincerely hope the MAS will carefully scrutinise the proposed sale of NTUC to Allianz in the interests of Singaporeans.",Economy,-0.7,0.95,0.9,0.9882,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ekj4a6,Reddit,5/8/2024 9:02

Why was the introduction of a middleman (GSA Pte Ltd) necessary?,"Mobile Guardian, it was apparent from the start, was a two-bit operation that implemented its product in a hideously amateurish way. The data breach a while back should have been a wake-up call, but it was not heeded.At the point the contract was awarded, larger, more established solutions serving educational institutions, providing essentially the same services, were available - namely, Jamf School and Mosyle. These companies had a large number of school districts in the US as customers, and would have been capable of providing better-tested, better-proven services to MOE.To date, MOE is probably Mobile Guardian's largest customer by far. We make 2 observations: Most of the recent reviews for the Mobile Guardian app seem to originate from Singapore-based users, and most of the company's clients appear to be single schools scattered around the world. To this extent, the MOE contract is a gold mine for the company.Millions of dollars of public money were spent on this fiasco. Singaporeans deserve to have this sum accounted for. We owe it to the students who lost their notes weeks before life-changing national exams.The CPIB, in particular, needs to ask a few questions, to satisfy itself that everything done was above-board. Let me give some suggestions as to the questions they ought to ask:1. Why was Mobile Guardian, a minor player with an unproven product (at least, at the scale MOE deployed it), chosen to provide the MDM solution for public schools in Singapore?2. Was it necessary for a middleman (i.e. GSA Pte Ltd) to be involved in the transaction? How much did GSA pay Mobile Guardian for the performance of the contract - that is, what profit did GSA derive from the transaction? What work did GSA do to deserve this profit? Why are there rumblings that a new PAP candidate in the upcoming election is involved in GSA Pte Ltd?3. Was a more established MDM solution not chosen because the need for a middleman (i.e. GSA Pte Ltd) would have been eliminated?

To be honest I'm kinda losing confidence in the capabilities of our government in leading the nation in the next decade. Granted, I might be exposed to subs that constantly sing negative narratives about the govt, but also coupled with the fact that I'm seeing how your average Singaporean is struggling with living in Singapore, it seems we're not led by our government in the right trajectory..Some recent screw ups by our govt (not exhaustive): 1. Mobile guardian - I can't imagine how wrecked the students might feel, getting their notes wiped out a few weeks before examinations.2. Recent national day speech, still utilizing LKY's name excessively3. Parliament debates on gerrymandering - how does redeawing electorial boundaries benefitting singaporeans? It's still not clear and CCS keeps avoiding answering the qn. 4. Needless to say, property & rent prices increase YOY, and inadventently increasing COL for all Sgreans5.

t3_1eop8a0,"Dear MOE, we really need to talk about cybersecurity","*Posted on behalf of u/Hopeful_Chocolate080, as part of a **sweet** partnership with u/Desperate_Vanilla808*Hi everyone, I'm the OP who recently posted the [correspondence with MOE regarding a trivial but critical vulnerability in Mobile Guardian]( and I'm back with some important updates.This was MOE's response to this incident, taken from the [Straits Times article]( (interestingly, MOE only thanked and sent me the same thing less than 30 minutes before it was released by the press):>We had immediately investigated the report, and found that the vulnerability had been picked up as part of an earlier security screening, and had already been patched.To clarify, the vulnerability was *not* patched less than an hour before the report was sent, at 9.13pm, and here is a [video evidence of the unpatched endpoint in question]( MOE's response to this was:>When we tried your exploit on 31 May, we were not successful. MG informed us that a pre-scheduled patch had already been deployed end day 30 May.Well, ok, sure, noted.Full email:  intention in sharing the correspondence has never been about *this specific vulnerability*. Rather, it has been to raise concerns regarding the steps MOE has taken to ensure the security of our personal data. I am confident in MOE's ability to address this particular vulnerability and understand that it was not the cause of the recent incident.With that said, I would like to address some broader points related to MOE's commitment to security:* It's noteworthy that while a secondary school student discovered this vulnerability in under three hours, it appears that MOE's independent audits and regular cybersecurity testing took nearly three years to do so. Evidence suggests that this vulnerability may have been present as early as August 2021.* When I initially claimed that I suspected a security issue on 18 May, I noticed a significant delay in communication, with MOE taking several working days to respond to each email. It is not difficult, yet very important, to have someone monitor communications and respond in real-time for alleged security vulnerabilities like these.* While the vulnerability was discovered through an earlier security screening, it seems there was no immediate action taken to disable the Mobile Guardian system (e.g. logins or signups) to prevent potential exploitation of the vulnerability before it was patched.Cybersecurity ought to be taken more seriously than this. It is already less relevant how the recent hack happened and whether it was caused by a more sophisticated attack; the fact that this trivial vulnerability existed for several years should itself raise concerns. There are many important questions that MOE needs to answer here.",Technology,-0.9,0.95,0.9,0.9825,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1eop8a0/dear_moe_we_really_need_to_talk_about/,Reddit,10/8/2024 9:47

t3_1eqcgue,About ActiveSG Balloting,"*In this post, I'm only going to talk about Badminton because I am a casual player that face so much challenges just to book a court.*So ActiveSG came out with new balloting system for booking of courts. I thought it was a good idea but it's bad. It's even more impossible to get a court now. And there are still so many people organising the games and profiting from it.**Breakdown of Costs and Profit for 1 Court**Item | Cost ----|-----Badminton Court (2 hours) | $14.80Shuttlecock (6x) | $14Total Costs | $28.80$10 ~ 12 per pax (Usually 6 pax per court) | $60 ~ $72**Profit** | **$30 ~ $43**So they make $30 ~ $43 for just 1 court, normally they are able to get 3 courts in a stadium and they do it DAILY. Just think of how much those organisers can make daily..Now let's compare the 2 system.**Before**Court bookings open up 15 days in advance on 7am. You use your phone to login to the app and book the courts. From what I know, a lot of them use multiple phones at the same time to try and book the court. So you're limited by the number of phones and how fast your fingers are. Very challenging to get a court on weekday nights. But it is still possible to get a court on weekends particularly in primary/secondary schools. **Now**You can ballot the court 14 days in advance at any time. The result will be out the next day. That means, now you can ask anybody (father/mother/son/brother/friend) to enroll for the balloting and increases the chance of getting the courts. I've tried balloting for a few weeks but have no chance to get any courts, even the ones in primary/secondary school.The new system is supposed to be fair for everyone but the ""organisers"" are just taking advantage of it. Just go to any facebook badminton group or meetup groups and you can see SO MANY games available. Example:  some people might say, ""they have to be there"", ""it's not easy to organise"". Sure, then why are casual players blocked out by those people just for them to earn money? The only term that I find relevant in ActiveSG T&C is this ""4.2.13 You are not allowed to assign, sublet or re-sell your booking of the ActiveSG Facility (or part thereof) without our prior written consent. Any such infringement will render the booking void, and we reserve the right to cancel the booking without prior notice in which case the booking fee paid shall be forfeited. You may be subjected to onsite checks. Please be ready to present your identification document and booking receipts ""I even e-mail and asked SportsSG if this is allowed, they only mentioned they will check and aren't able to disclose the information. But the same person are still able to organise so many games. Imagine paying tax money to have these facilities built and maintained but then have people taking advantage of it to earn money. I really hope the government can look into this issue and clamp down on all these bookings.",Infrastructure,-0.8,0.9,0.7,0.9761,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1eqcgue/about_activesg_balloting/,Reddit,12/8/2024 12:31
t3_1eqfhae,"My fellow Singaporeans, please do not be led astray by mainstream media","# Some Clarifications on the Mobile Guardian Cyberattack\[Taken from multiple comments, because we believe that more people needs to see this\]Sequel to:[ now, you should have heard about the Mobile Guardian cyberattack and the fact that u/Hopeful_Chocolate080 raised the alarm about a vulnerability first, which MOE claims to have fixed.Truth be told, many mainstream news outlets are merely trying to downplay this ""vulnerability"", some even portraying it to be a high-level, complex, US CIA Military operation.# It is not!It is a trivial mistake, in fact the first one listed on OWSAP. It is a very rudimentary and fundamental error that no developer should ever make -- involving improper access control.[ CNA is evidently pushing out the ""lies"" by interviewing experts.Here is one such example of a *misleading* statement by[CNA]( organisations sign contracts with these service providers, they typically have to go through very thorough protocols and analyses of their security functions, said director of Infinity Forensics Ali Fazeli.>But in many cases, the provider will continue to add features and update the system. If the users are not that strict when it comes to implementing these changes and updates, these could give rise to vulnerabilities, he added.>They do have very good procedures to check whether everything is secure, however, software is quite complex. Even though you go through the best source code analysis there is always a part of the system that analysts cannot identify as a threat, said Mr Fazeli.>Hackers typically use these unknown vulnerabilities to gain access to the system, he added.>When organisations sign contracts with these service providers, they typically have to go through very thorough protocols and analyses of their security functions, said director of Infinity Forensics Ali Fazeli.To reiterate, this bug was not likely introduced due to an update; rather, **it has likely been there from the start!**It gives readers the impression that the bug was introduced in some update. The ugly reality is that it has been present since Aug 2021 (and perhaps earlier) until recently. **However, to the laymen, CNA** **seems to suggest that the whole incident is inevitable, because ""software is quite complex"" with the ""add\[ition of\] features**"" **and updat\[ing\] the system"" and hackers using ""unknown vulnerabilities"".****CNA did not respond to our emails when we tried to supply additional information about the vulnerability. We wonder why.**I do have to give some credit to \[the Straits Times\]( for at least talking about the vulnerability in slightly more detail, including details like improper access control, though ideally they should have included the fact that the user took three minutes to show how trivial the issue is:>In the post, the user said he had sent multiple e-mails to MOE and Mobile Guardian about the vulnerabilities he had discovered about the app.>When ST reached out to the user, the user sent transcripts of his e-mail correspondence with both Mobile Guardian and MOE, which included information about improper access control which the user claimed would allow for the reading and modification of all data in Mobile Guardians systems.>Highlighting the vulnerability, the user wrote out steps showing how to access the Mobile Guardian admin portal.This pales in comparison to \[CNA\]( They merely brushed it off as a security vulnerability without giving more details.:>Earlier this week, an individual on Reddit claimed that they had previously informed MOE about Mobile Guardians security vulnerabilities, uploading screenshots of email threads starting from May 30.Compare it to[TechCrunchs reporting]( is factual, straight to the point and not beating around the bush with what-ifs and yappanese:>Direct, clear and straight to the point. Do you already see the stark differences in the reporting?**I think at this juncture, it is important to clarify that both of us students,****and****, have*****nothing*****against the government or the ruling party. We are not at all anti-PAP. We do not want to use this incident to attack the credibility of the PAP. We are not even eligible to vote yet. What others do with this incident is really their choice, and we have to respect that. While we must give credit when credit is due (and rightly so, PAP deserves credit for seeing our country through the times), we must also learn to recognise and criticize flaws.****My personal take is that this was just an unfortunate case of mismanagement within MOE. We do not want to nor do we intend to stir up trouble in the political realm or discontent or even unhappiness within society.**We understand the MSM may not want to report certain issues (we all have our own agendas, after all), and thats fine because thats their (or their bosses choice). So we are taking this to this public forum where people can hear from us about the facts of this incident, first-hand, objectively (at least from our pov while keeping yall updated on the governments replies).**It is also important to note that we do not fully agree with the way**[ Gutzy reported this incident since they have conveniently left out some details, including the fact that MOE has said that a patch was done end day 30 May.]( post highlighted that while MOE claimed the vulnerability had been patched by 30 May, they provided a video showing that the endpoint in question appeared to remain unpatched even after MOEs assurance.Do note that MOE has clarified that the endpoint has been patched at end day 30 May. \[[source]( just want everyone to know the truth and be consciously aware of the incident instead of being fed lies or having the truth distorted and the having the issue played down through the lenses of MSM (or any other media). We genuinely believe that the public deserves the truth, even though it would be much easier for us, and maybe even the govt, if we had simply shut up and kept mum.****At the same time, we want to raise awareness about cybersecurity among the population. The importance of having your own backups or mitigating measures (from students, parents and even the government) because you can never 100% trust any system. Everyone makes the wrong calls, and the government is not immune to that.**The fact that the government nationally selected two DMA vendors back in 2020 and centrally controlled restrictions and blocklists suggested that they do care for the well-being of students. It would have been much easier if the government just left this matter up to schools and for schools to choose their DMA if they want to. They would simply not have this problem in the first place. But it is crucial to recognise that they had these good intentions (in virtue, perhaps), and we must commend that (though of course security concerns were raised then). But perhaps (in hindsight) the government could have failed in certain aspects, like properly auditing MG, for instance, for security before onboarding it. I will not speculate here because I do not know what happened within the government at that time. Some may call this a long-term systematic failure of the government, and I will not disagree with you. **This government appears to have a track record of choosing the cheapest vendors without really weighing the opp costs.**But it is my hope -- I repeat my hope -- that the government will get stronger and hopefully learn and improve their tender and vulnerability reporting processes. Or else who knows what may happen in future? ERP 2.0/SimplyGo system hack because of shoddy security by a negligent vendor?Anyway, both of us are looking forward to the next parliament sitting!We believe that there must at least be accountability (within the government and even MG themselves) for this incident that has impacted many of us students. And I trust that the government is doing an internal investigation as we speak.I would really hate to find out if the government broke that trust if they did so.",Technology,-0.7,0.85,0.8,0.9825,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1eqfhae/my_fellow_singaporeans_please_do_not_be_led/,Reddit,12/8/2024 14:40

t3_1ercqec,Bus users in Tampines North de-prioritised as motorists successfully lobby for bus-only road to be downgraded to peak hour bus lane,"The right turning lane between Tampines Avenue 12 and Tampines North Drive 2 has been a bus-only lane that motorists are not allowed to drive on since the road opened in 2022. It acts as a modal filter that makes bus journeys more direct than those of cars in certain turning movements, encouraging car-lite modes of travel.However, the motorists living in Tampines North have successfully lobbied for the bus-only lane to be passable to cars at most hours. This will increase vehicular traffic along Tampines North Drive 2, now a through route for cars, potentially making it noisier for the residents living there and less safe for pedestrians, thus discouraging active modes of travel for short trips to nearby amenities like schools and childcare centres.Motorists can now save a few minutes to get into and out of the estate where it was previously not possible to, while public transport commuters on bus services 46, 129, and 298 will also have to take longer to get to where they are going as their bus waits behind queuing cars making that right turn.What do you guys think about this?",Transport,-0.8,0.9,0.7,0.9657,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ercqec,Reddit,13/8/2024 16:43

There are just so many things to object about this deal, including the following: (1) unfair treatment of minority shareholders vis--vis NTUC Enterprise, (2) breach of good faith by NTUC Enterprise re their statement to remain majority shareholder of Income post-corporatisation, (3) Income Insurance becoming a profit-maximisation commercial company, vs operating as a non-profit maximisation entity with social mission, which will impact on many of Incomes 1.7m existing policyholders, (4) conflict or possible conflict of interest involved re Income appointing Morgan Stanley as their financial advisor etc, which was brushed over by MASs Mr Chee Hong Tat in Parliament recently etcI wish to also object to Incomes management, ex-Ministers and current Ministers spouting many absurd, illogical and redundant statements to gloss over the publics objections to the sale. Aside from making themselves look foolish, we, the constituents do NOT like your colleagues continuing to (i) talk us down, assuming that we are stupid and (ii) insult our intelligence.

I am taking the time to write to you because I am concerned about the way this country is heading, including the sale of Income, which looks like the establishment is pushing down the throats of the stakeholders. Stop the sale.Your response, or non-response, to my above views and my request, will determine how I vote in the coming General Elections.

t3_1es4fty,Is it reasonable for bus drivers to stop this far away from waiting commuters at bus stops?,"Genuinely curious about the rules for bus drivers alighting commuters at bus stops. Just encountered this today and often. Instead of stopping properly at the bus stop, the bus driver stops at the location as shown in the picture (the bus in the picture has stopped and is not moving), even though there were no buses in front. The commuter who alights out of the bus ends up alighting outside the bus stop and commuters waiting at the bus stop have to walk over to board the bus. Ive seen many bus drivers who appear to do this deliberately stopping far away from waiting commuters at the bus stop. Is this reasonable practice, as it sometimes feels like bus drivers are low-key pranking the waiting commuters by making them rush over to the bus (especially inconvenient for the elderly and less mobile)?",Transport,-0.6,0.85,0.7,-0.9332,https://i.redd.it/v8713gycdnid1.jpeg,Reddit,14/8/2024 15:23
t3_1esm7aj,What exactly was the point of activesg+?,"Today was the first day after migrating from the ActiveSG app. So they mentioned on the FAQ, that all passes will be prorated and refunded if the previous passes exceed the cut of date which was yesterday. (I have yet to see any refunds on my side)1) So in order to get this the website, you need to save the website onto your phone home screen. Or save it on a tab and leave it.2) I bought my pass and its no longer a qr code. Simply a picture to show the staff, granted it's a moving picture to prevent screenshot. But what's stopping someone from just sharing the account with the pass? It's not like the staff at the counter is gonna slowly check the names one by one (if that's the case, it's even worse for the staff)3) With the app, we could also see how crowded the gym was, this feature is available most likely due to the check in , via qr code. Now the website doesn't have anything in replacement. 4) I saw that the tablet on the counter has a count in checker for the number of people in the gym, I guess this is manually done by the staff (more senseless work for them). So there's still a limit on number of people allowed in the gym. 5) I also saw some previous reddit comments that the balloting system is even worse than before. But I don't have any personal experience myself since I don't partake.All I can say is that this whole thing seems so archaic and backward thinking like we're in the early 2000s again. Know that money, manpower, time was spent on creating an app, just so that they can put even more money, more manpower and more time to do something even worse than before. Sure it's not as big of huha as simplygo or ERP 2 since its not affecting a lot of people, as almost everyone is at the other gym brands or have their own gym at home. (please don't come at me with comments, just go other gyms lah)The issues mentioned above isn't as big but the reason of the rant for ***ActiveSG-*** is this:A. What was trigger point that led to the creation of activesg+B. What was the point of activesg+ that the app can't doC. Most importantly, how much money is spent on this when such money could have been spent to build more gyms or get new equipments or renovate old gyms. To add on, 10 dollars is given to those who migrated before the cut off date.

t3_1eyaxck,Changi Airport's land and sea transport are still lacking,"Changi Airport is a major source of national pride and justifiably so; Jewel especially is a feather in the cap. It has been designed primarily as a hub airport in mind and that's evident from the facilities, such as massive transit areas and security checks only at the gate (except T4) to prevent congestion. That being said, it's also important that the airport serves Singapore and its hinterland well. To that effect, the current ground and sea transport options are still lacking: - While there has been an MRT connection for more than two decades now, it's chronically underused. Through service to the EWL was abandoned shortly after opening, and in hindsight wasn't worth all the money and pretty architecture. It will be downgraded to a medium-capacity line once it's connected and converted to TEL. Crucially, unlike most other air hubs, there is no express rail service to the city. The only practical option, especially with heavy luggage and/or going outside of the east, is by car - which is not only prone to congestion but also runs counter to the car-lite philosophy. - Bus service is also limited, crucially without either 1) express services or 2) overnight services. The buses that do service the airport are regular routes and only to a few destinations. There is/was a minibus shuttle service (not sure if it still exists) BUT it only serves certain hotels and runs on-demand, not scheduled. Passengers who land late or arrive early have no other choice but to travel via taxi/PHV. This is unlike nearly all other airports I have been. HKG, in contrast, offers excellent double-decker express services to not only downtown but various satellite new towns. **This issue would be easiest to solve: have 24-hour express services serving between the airport and various pick-up points/bus interchanges around the island.** - Sea transfers: I know there is a shuttle bus between the airport and Tanah Merah ferry terminal to serve Batam, but again, the T5 expansion offers an opportunity to emulate HKG's SkyPier - where passengers can head from/to nearby ports without going through immigration. Crucially, this can be expanded to support JB as well: not only does it heed the Johor state govt's call for more ferry links, this could also curtail the perennial issue of illegal airport transfers by Malaysian operators. I expect the rejoinder to be that the current options are good enough, since nobody else is complaining - if it ain't broke, don't fix it, need to consider livelihoods of taxi/PHV drivers etc.. But it's the soft side that does need some more improvement to further accentuate Changi's profile as a leading airport.",Transport,-0.6,0.9,0.8,0.9869,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1eyaxck/changi_airports_land_and_sea_transport_are_still/,Reddit,22/8/2024 4:52

t3_1f1kn7t,"The dissolution of GEP is not as simple as it seems - it might have negative effects on all students, not only GEP students","Everyone should be extremely concerned about this GEP revamp (dissolution) as it could affect all students, regardless of their ability level. When under-stimulated gifted kids are placed in a class of 40 students undergoing a mind-numbing standard curriculum, they tend to direct their energies in ways that would negatively affect the other students.**TL;DR (By our friendly AI tool)**>!The dissolution of the GEP could have severe consequences for both gifted students and their peers. Gifted students may no longer receive the intellectual stimulation and support they need to reach their potential, which could lead to broader classroom disruptions and social difficulties.!<>!Although the government claims that the new program will benefit more students by expanding the reach of advanced opportunities, this is misleading. The after-school programs that are being offered as replacements have been in place for years and were already targeting higher-ability students. These programs, often lasting just one hour a week, lack the depth, intensity, and specialized support that the GEP provided. Simply increasing the percentage of students who can access these limited programs does not equate to providing the same level of enrichment and challenge that the GEP offered.!<>!As a result, this so-called expansion is more about diluting the quality of education for gifted students than genuinely broadening opportunities for others. Parents and educators should be concerned about these changes and advocate for solutions that truly address the diverse needs of all students.!<**Glossary of terms**|Term|Meaning||:-|:-||GEP (Curriculum)|Gifted Education Programme (Specialized curriculum that stretches Gifted students to unlock their potential)||Higher-ability programmes|After school classes like E2K for Math and Science, or debate and writing for higher ability students||Normal (curriculum)|The standardized curriculum every student goes through.||High ability students|The typical smarter student you see in normal classes. Although they may grasp concepts quickly, they're not infallible.||Gifted students|The top 1% of the cohort who are really intellectually gifted. They grasp even the hardest of concepts at levels above them (O/A levels) without issue.|# What is the Gifted Education Programme?From [MOE's website]( GEP is a programme to ""cater for the needs of intellectually gifted students"". You may ask, what 'needs' do intellectually gifted (not high ability) students need? For one, intellectually gifted (gifted hereafter) students find every aspect of the normal curriculum extremely simple. Their 'needs' refer to the need of intellectual stimulation beyond the range of peers at their age. For example, gifted kids at P3 can already be learning about A-level Science concepts at their own free time. You might also ask about the difference between a gifted student and a high ability (HA hereafter) student. Gifted students are literally years ahead compared to their peers. These gifted students make up only 1% of the student cohort ^(\^1) ([source]( HA students make up around 7% of the student population^(\^1) ([source]( clear distinction between the gifted and HA students are also apparent in class. HA students tend to get bored in class as well, but they are not infallible and still tend to have many learning gaps. Gifted students get bored in class, mostly because they really know and understand everything in the normal curriculum.>**The goals of the GEP are to:**>Develop intellectual depth and higher level thinking.>Nurture productive creativity.>Develop attitudes for self-directed lifelong learning.>Enhance aspirations for individual excellence and fulfilment.>Develop a strong social conscience and commitment to serve society and the nation.>Develop moral values and qualities for responsible leadership.The GEP programme was literally started to meet the increased intellectual needs of 1% of our population, to allow them to achieve their potential. If current MOE leaders can't tell the difference between a gifted child and a HA child, they're really being deliberately disingenuous. **Why is the GEP curriculum special?**Based on [MOE's website]( the GEP curriculum covers more advanced topics, goes deeper and provides for collaboration with tertiary institutions.They are also able to embark on [Individualised Study Options (ISOs)]( where they do real research through special programmes.**How are students selected?**Based on [MOE's website]( there are 2 stages: 1. Screening test (EL and Math)2. Selection test (EL, Math and General Ability)Students who pass both tests will be posted to a GEP school where they will be put in a GEP class (of 20-30(?)) students who will undergo a *specialized GEP* curriculum. # Why has the GEP programme been abolished?From the press release [^(1)]( the goal of this abolishment was to:* Broaden opportunities for pupils (benefit more pupils)* Move away from assessing them by a single yardstick (GEP selection)**How will it work?**Based on a [press release]( Screening test at P3 will be kept, while the second stage (selection test) will be dropped. 2. Students who are selected will take part in school-based programmes (E2K Science/Math, EL writing or debate).3. Students will have multiple opportunities to join these school-based programmes from P4-P6.4. ""GEP"" students have opportunities to go to other schools for after-school programmes.**These school-based programmes have already been targeting HA students for the past 20-30 years**The only observable change is that instead of a single selection process at the end of P3, now students can get assessed every year to join these programmes. Touting the new approach as: >""largely similar"" to the current programmes for higher-ability learners and the current GEP programmeIs extremely disingenuous as after-school programmes that run for 1 hour each week are nowhere close to the goals or execution of the GEP curriculum. The existing after-school programmes will just be expanded to accommodate 10% (up from 7%) of students to benefit more students, while the first GEP selection test will still be carried out.# Why is this a problem?Gifted students are now forced to undergo the same standard curriculum that bores them to the core, disallowing them from actually reaching their potential. If that wasn't bad enough, guess what bored students do? They find ways to entertain themselves. Some might be self sufficient in their entertainment, while others act up in ways that would hinder the learning of the other 39 students in the class. Recently, the Primary school syllabus has also changed. It has become more open-ended and self-exploratory due to the buzzword ""hollistic"" 5-10 years ago when they started planning it. The concepts have also been getting more and more complex and packed, lessening the time available to learn each concept. Teachers are now more of facilitators, and facilitating the self-exploration and inquiry of 40 students is extremely impossible given the packed curriculum. You just can't cover every student with the time you have.Note that none of what I've said above would be too much of a problem for a gifted student. They'd still be snacking on the standard curriculum like a bag of chips. Now in a class of 40 students, the gifted student would not get enough mental stimulation and get bored (and maybe act out). Or the teacher could engage the gifted students while the rest of the students get bored because it's out of their depth and act out. It's already difficult to engage HA students with the normal curriculum, much less a gifted one. Of course it's not an absolute, but you'd get the idea. **MOE has admitted that there may be **[**some reduction**]( in the intensity of enrichment as compared to the current GEP**>higher-ability learners will be adequately engaged and hoslistically developed through school-based programmes.So consequently, they won't be ""adequately engaged"" and ""hollistically developed"" through the standard curriculum. This dumbed down revamp is basically the *removal of the GEP programme*. **There will still be better schools with regards to ""GEP"" even though there aren't any GEP schools anymore**The current GEP schools would have the resources and specially trained teachers to beef up whatever after-school programmes they already had, but non-GEP schools will not have specially trained GEP teachers nor the years of experience and resources available. **The GEP programme wasn't only about academics**Former [GEP ]( ([both ]( [reddit ]( news articles) have [attested ]( a [few ]( Smaller class size - As much as OYK wants to cherrypick studies that show increased class sizes don't help, they do. Otherwise why would GEP classes have almost half the normal number of students?2. Being intellectually stimulated from discussions with like-minded peers - GEP students were able to further challenge each other as they were more or less able to understand the deeper concepts.3. Feeling safer to speak up, or be themselves - These gifted kids might've become targets of bullies in the normal stream as many of them tend to be ""nerdier"" or [neuroatypical ]( GEP students on reddit).>[Dr Johannis Auri Abdul Aziz]( a former GEP student, said the gifted programme was not only about academics.>Citing a MOE handbook that said the GEP also catered to the social and emotional needs of its students, he said: In a sense, its not just a gifted programme. Its also a special needs programme.>A 2005 study of former GEP students found that some have trouble coping and are ostracised by their non-GEP classmates.>Recalling his days in GEP as being both good and bad, socially speaking, Dr Johannis said: Kids can be cruel. There was a fair share of admiration, as well as resentment and some amount of rejection.>This is why having friends with a common experience can be valuable and people who are more accepting of you, said the 44-year-old, adding that he made many lifelong friends from his days in GEP.**MOE is being deliberately** [disingenuous ]( saying that ""All primary schools have teachers specially trained to teach high-ability learners"" to back up their programme revamp**For one, GEP teachers were specially trained to handle the intellectual, emotional and behavioral needs of gifted children. Secondly, MOE is refusing to admit that the top 1% of gifted children are not the same as the 7% of HA students. The problem isn't about having suitable after-school programmes, because schools have had these programmes for years. The issue is with teachers being able to engage these gifted children in a class of 39 while executing the standard (boring and intellectually limiting) curriculum.The idea of inclusivity in the past decade has resulted in each class having more and more children with behavioral needs. Even when a child starts hurting other classmates, teachers' hands are tied because the schools will not dish out any proper consequence. Some primary school students have learning disabilities (can't even read or write or speak English at P6 level), but are still allowed to stay in mainstream schools. Teachers are already stretched thin, trying to juggle the increased amount of discipline issues brought about by these ""inclusivity"" outliers, and now they have to grapple with the prospect of having gifted kids who might act out in boredom, or go for hours of extra training courses.Without having time to even plan for lessons nowadays (due to nonsensical admin work), this might just be the final nail in the coffin for many teachers. (Hearsay, don't POFMA), that many teachers have left service in the recent years. Some schools are running skeleton crews with flexi-adjuncts making up as much as 20% of the teacher population. MOE might be begging ex-teachers to come back full time. ^1 Introduced in 1984, GEP seeks to nurture intellectually gifted students and 1 per cent or about 370 to 400 students of each cohort are enrolled into the programme. Right now, around 7 per cent of the yearly cohort attend such school-based programmes (after school programmes that cater to HA students).",Education,-0.9,0.97,0.9,0.9994,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1f1kn7t/the_dissolution_of_gep_is_not_as_simple_as_it/,Reddit,26/8/2024 10:13

t3_1f3hzcl,"Does anyone else notice the increase in ""unsafe"" PHV?","So, as the title suggests, I've noticed more and more PHV drivers doing unsafe things to the inside of their vehicles. Now, for the record, I barely take PHV, but it seems that at least for the past 3-4 times i've taken it, they've all had some variation of the ""claymore"" anti-personnel mine.Just today, I rode in one where the front of the steering wheel was meticulously lined with multiple ornamental rocks... leaving out space for the ""SRS AIRBAG"" label on the plastic part... In the event of a crash, that airbag is gonna deploy and send all of that rock as shrapnel into anything soft (i.e. driver and passenger).A month ago, I was in some cryptobro's Toyota Sienta. I respect the dude trying to hustle... bank account as his phone wallpaper, ""to the moon"" graph on his grab phone... and a giant, thick, solid metal porsche badge taped over the Toyota logo on the steering wheel. Now, it may just be me worrying but... in the event of a crash... that porsche badge is going to be launched straight at the driver's skill, or the passenger sitting behind him...Like I understand, ideal circumstances, a safe driver will not crash... but there's still the risk that another unsafe driver will slam into you, resulting in your airbags deploying and potentially killing the driver and/or passenger. I have also seen cars where the airbag cover on dashboard is covered in random bits and bobs, with some of them having insanely sharp religious objects. Again, a crash is going to launch that at really high speed and cause injuries/death.Personally, I feel we should have a safety inspection of vehicles used for PHV or commercial purposes. Having a system where you can cancel a booking if you perceive it ""not being safe"" might be helpful but is gonna be prone to misuse.

t3_1f7bfbm,My rejected forum letter to the Straits Times: Singapore's Car-lite ambitions all bark but little bite,"I'll post it here as an open letter instead, since ST doesn't want to publish this. Too critical? Too little bootlicking? I'll let you decide.---As an urban planning enthusiast, I have been following with keen interest Singapore's car-lite plans in recent years. I was heartened to read about developments such as car-lite towns (e.g. Tengah), or [the planned expansion of Singapore's cycling path network to 1,300km by 2030]( yet ultimately disappointed at their implementations. It seems that despite the many proclamations of going car-lite, Singapore is only taking half-hearted measures of limited effectiveness.To be clear, going car-lite is not a novel ambition for a city to pursue. Cities all around the world have taken massive steps towards reducing their reliance on cars. For instance, [New York City]( has converted car lanes in many of its arterial downtown avenues into protected bike and bus lanes. [Paris]( closed down major roads, converting them to bike highways, and removed >70% of parking spaces to accommodate cyclists - both growing cycling traffic and reducing car ownership significantly. San Francisco, Oslo, Copenhagen, and many more other cities are taking similar steps to reduce car usage and promote walking, cycling, and public transit.In all these case studies, a common theme is redesigning physical infrastructure to be less car centric.Yet, in Singapore, this aspect has been neglected. Singapore's physical infrastructure remains steadfastly car-centric. Most of the new bike lanes I see are not reclaiming space from cars, but from pedestrians. What used to be a wider pavement has been split down the middle, to be shared by both pedestrians and cyclists. Meanwhile, the wide roads for cars remain untouched. This is true even in supposedly car-lite Tengah.The most glaring example of unjustifiable car-centric design is in Singapore's downtown CBD - Singapore's most walkable, transit-dense, and connected region. In the area with arguably the least need to drive, [Robinson Road]( features 5 wide lanes for vehicles but narrow pavements for humans to share. Singapore's CBD bike lane network consists of painted lines on pavements, while the wide, 5-6 lanes of road space are seemingly and inexplicably protected and untouchable.It is hardly surprising then that car owners are reluctant to give up driving, because Singapore's infrastructure and policies continually reinforce the car as the superior mode of transportation. All the painted bike lanes and reclaimed pavements will hardly make a dent in changing travel patterns, as long as the car remains at the top of the hierarchy.True car-lite cities in the world do not need COEs to forcibly cap car ownership rates. Instead, car-liteness is achieved when policies and infrastructure prioritize non-car modes of travel such that people naturally opt out of driving. In Singapore, it seems the authorities want to have their cake and eat it too - by preserving the status quo of the car as king of the road, yet trying to convince the population to leave their keys at home.",Politics,-0.9,0.9,0.8,0.9818,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1f7bfbm/my_rejected_forum_letter_to_the_straits_times/,Reddit,2/9/2024 16:44

He is so so so pro China nowadays (but his Chinese/Mandarin still sucks it seems), too much for my liking.Yeo Guat Kwang: while he was a MP, at one time, he held advisor, member of committees, director roles in 64 organization. A true multi talented person.Indranee: I just feel like her role in parliament is similar to Shan's, as the attack d0g to launch attack at oppositions.Chee Hong Tat: it all started with his aggressive pose in his debut election on the day of nomination. Since then, I never like him.Kenneth Jeyaratnam: some times he said really stupid things.Lim Tean: he said crazy things.Tin Pei Ling: how she started her political career, and her ""job hopping"" recently.Lawrence Wong: I was neutral on him, until one election, he and Denise Phua were on a CNA forum with CSJ, and he kept attacking CJS's previous records (the defemation case).Ivan Lim: no need explanation",Politics,-0.8,0.9,0.8,-0.8463,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1fe586w/which_mpspoliticians_disgustirritate_the_most/,Reddit,11/9/2024 8:32

I don't blame the stall owners because apparently rentals have increased and they have to increase price to keep their business open. A few stalls with good and affordable food have moved out.I live near a wet market and it has been my source of relatively more affordable food, but it is going to be renovated soon and replaced with a new mixed development with a wet market and I'm sure price will go up a lot once they reopen.There is another hawker centre near my old house that still had $3.5 shredded chicken noodle. Found out that they are also under renovation now. I don't think they will still have those prices once they reopen.The Kopitiam was perfectly fine and still looked very new; why do they need to spend money to renovate and increase price? The wet market as well, it's a beautiful place with very nice architecture, and I always see a lot of nice corners for the uncles and aunties to hang out there.I understand that these constant renovation is what keeps Singapore always looking new and modern; unlike cities like Hong Kong. But may be we don't need such complete and total renovation? Maybe the toilet was old, in that case can we just renovate those toilets and leave the rest? Why do we need to tear down the whole thing and build something totally different?Just want to vent. I don't need swanky new things. I just want my food to be affordable.

We dug a little deeper and found that the syllabus had been changed for 2025. I found it hilarious that, of all subjects, Computing had a question like this...which to me, traditionally belonged to Social Studies. Social Studies is well known for teaching the government's narrative on its policies. The more cynical amongst us would say it's the method of choice for PAP's indoctrination. To be fair, the changes to the syllabus also include PDPA and Copyright Act. However, I can't help but the note that even the framing of the question seemed a bit loaded and *over*-redundant . Why is it specifically: ""Identify two penalties that can be imposed using POFMA *in tackling fake news*."" rather than simply ""Identify two penalties that can be imposed using POFMA"". So what do you think? Welcome change to make the syllabus more holistic by MOE or that the PAP treats the public views of POFMA so seriously that it must be taught to teenagers.For those interested, you can easily google SEAB computing 2025 and other years to see the differences.",Education,-0.9,0.95,0.8,0.7427,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1fjo7sd/revision_to_computing_olevel_syllabus_in_2025/,Reddit,18/9/2024 8:52

t3_1fowiuo,"Is there an alternative to Singapore's ""Population and economic growth at all costs"" model?","Full disclaimer: I'm not an economist or analyst or whatever, I'm just a uni student who's stuck in their assignment and wanted to distract myself. In the past 48 hours there have been several posts regarding Singapore's economy, population growth, foreign workers, public transport, housing prices, low birthrates high deathrates etc. I've been here long enough to know how the comments were going to play out: Negative tone, saying that our government has really pushed for an unsustainable population and economic growth above all else, how the PAP has lost its ways, how we're all just cogs in this machine, how we should leave this place if we have the chance etc etc. I've reached the point where I no longer read these comments and just filter them out because I feel they ruin my mood. But the thing that has been bugging me is: These comments aren't inherently wrong. The facts and figures don't lie, people are just reacting to them online because that's the only thing they can do.As far as I know, every country in the world wants an increasing population and a soaring economy. Every country that has negative growth and a declining population always view it as a very bad problem. More people=More money. Who doesn't want that? So we've hit 6 million people, and Redditporeans say that's too many. But what exactly can we do? We need the foreign workers to work the jobs Singaporeans don't want to do, we need the immigrants to supplement the low birthrate, and we can't fix the low birthrate fast enough because our ""competitive, companies first, workers second"" stance is why the companies even came here in the first place (this one might be my own bias). The only ""real"" solution that I can see, is that Singapore lets our economy slow down, let growth drop and implement reforms that make life better for Singaporeans, everything that Redditporeans say that want to see. 4 day work week, popping that housing bubble, WFH if possible, slashing immigration rates. Companies start leaving because they don't want to reform, the population starts to drop as the jobs aren't there anymore, and the Singaporeans become happier. This comes at the expense to our economy and our global competitiveness. I don't know how bad this scenario will be, or if it's even a bad thing at all, but I've got a feeling that there is some horrible caveat to this that I haven't been able to figure out. Redditporeans love to comment that the 1990s was the best time for Singapore, until the government decided to accelerate immigration and economic growth, at the expense to our people, the housing infrastructure and the transport infrastructure. This decision was made a decade before I was born, and I'm living through its consequences. Maybe we grew too big for our own good?

After the COE was introduced in 1990 to curb the population of vehicles, the population of vehicles instead steadily grew from just over 200,000 and balooned to almost 1 million cars we have today. The same year in 1990, the govt also set a quota for the percentage of growth of 3% for automobile vehicles on our roads where it was revised again constantly till today where its capped at 0.25%.. For reference: New York City with a land size around the size of singapore, they recorded over 1k deaths to road traffic accident for a vehicle population of around 2 million. In constrast, Singapore recorded just over 130+ deaths and is slowly inching towards one million vehicles.These statistics somewhat looks quite good if compared to new york but...

t3_1g7rouy,This Highly touted route to success was never meant to be follow from the start to the end,"Had some midnight thoughts on the govt and came to a realisation that there is a highly touted route that has echoed through many parents minds. Whether this route was a perception by the governemnt or was just a route that passed through generations. This route seem to follow what a ton of parents want their child to follow through their life and has always been the basis to succeed especially in singapore.By learning the basics in your teens, then exploring the world in your 20s. Forging a career by your 30s in a foreign nation to expand your scope of horizons Using the new found skills over a decade and return to singapore to continue a career here Work through your 50s and retire after working a decade or multiple decadesNow this route is practically impossible to follow through from the start to the end, but parents constantly use this route to plan for their child's future.What parents may not know is this pre determine route may have just been a failproof plan so no matter how old you are, you can. still decide to use a future goal to get back on track in society. Even if you were to never follow anything simillar to this route, you know there is still this safety net for you to bounce back with.Eg. Even by the time you turn 51 years old and still have not forged a career, you can set a goal to retire by working through your 60s.orEven if you are in your 40s and have never left singapore, you can still set a goal to build skills and use it to reroute your life to work through your 50s and beyond.This route in fact could be used to encourage people to explore beyond the norm fully knowing they got this failproof plan they can return to if their life dont go the way they want.What are thoughs on this ""net"" for people, Is it actually viable as a means for people to use and get back on track in society?",Education,-0.6,0.85,0.7,0.8847,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1g7rouy/this_highly_touted_route_to_success_was_never/,Reddit,20/10/2024 5:27

t3_1g7yv3h,Exposing a Huge Flaw in the Current BTO Balloting System,"In recent BTO exercises, HDB requires applicants to ballot for all projects within an estate instead of individual ones. This approach is creating significant issues, particularly when people have their eyes on a specific project but are forced to consider other projects within the same estate. For example, the recent BTO launch includes 3 bundled Bedok projects (2 Bayshore sites and 1 Kembangan site) and 3 bundled Kallang/Whampoa sites (1 Lavender site, 1 Whampoa site, 1 Upper Boon Keng site). Applicants do not have the option to ballot for a single site; they must enter the ballot for all sites in the same bundle.# 1. ""Forced to Choose"" to avoid New Penalty RulesOne of the primary issues is that applicants aiming for a specific project are automatically entered into a ballot for every project in the estate. If they fail to get a favorable queue number for their desired project, they may be forced to choose from other projects that they may have no real interest in. Otherwise, theyll have to face a one-year wait-out penalty where they are barred from balloting again.This creates an undesirable situation where applicants must either settle for a less appealing project just to avoid the penalty, or be locked out of the system for a year. Its not just about getting lucky in the current state, even ""average luck"" wont suffice if applicants are aiming for highly sought-after projects. Let's look at the current BTO exercise as an example: those who are interested in Crawford Heights (prime location with only 234 4R units) are currently competing with 1,880 other applicants, meaning only about the top 15% will secure a unit at Crawford Heights, while the rest must choose between the other two projects (Towner Breeze and Kallang View) or face the one-year penalty. Now this used to be less of an issue in previous exercises where projects were bundled together as an estate. For example October 2023's Kallang/Whampoa BTO launch also had 3 different sites bundled together, and while one is a PLH, the other two are standard flats with 5 year MOP. If applicants were not able to select their desired PLH flat, they could still choose either of the standard flats and only serve a 5-year MOP. This provided applicants with a valuable safety net: if they could not secure their preferred PLH flat, they still had the option to select one of the standard flats and only commit to a 5-year MOP, allowing for greater flexibility in their housing decisions. Not to mention, these standard flats came with no restrictions, were still situated in prime areas, and held significant potential profit after just 5 years. Unfortunately, all Kallang/Whampoa projects in the current exercise are at least Plus flats, and have a 10 year MOP. This means that applicants could potentially be locked into a longer commitment in a home they might not genuinely want. Whether due to job relocations, changes in family size, or shifts in personal preferences, being tied to a property for such an extended period can severely limit options.**2. Pitfalls of Married Child Priority Scheme (MCPS)**The MCPS is designed to encourage applicants to live near their parents by granting them an extra ballot chance for projects located close to their parents' homes. However, in large estates like Kallang/Whampoa, the geographic spread of available projects can be quite vast. This creates a situation where people aiming for a specific project near their parents may find themselves instead needing to consider another project that is far from them.Moreover, applicants can apply for this scheme as long as at least one of the units bundled together is near their parents, thereby birthing a potential loophole in this scheme whereby applicants can use their proximity advantage to gain a better chance for a project that is not actually near their parents. For instance, someone who qualifies for the scheme because their parents live near Project A could use that extra ballot chance to select a unit in Project B, even if Project B is far from their parents (assuming both Project A and B are lumped into the same estate). This undermines the original purpose of the scheme, which is meant to facilitate closer family living, not provide an unfair advantage for unrelated projects.**3. Neglecting Locational Differences and Individual Needs** Lumping multiple projects into a single estate-wide ballot fails to account for both the geographical spread and applicants' individual preferences. In large estates like Kallang/Whampoa, projects can be located far apart, making it unfair to treat them as one choice. Applicants aiming for a specific location may end up balloting for projects that are not as conveniently located. This approach also disregards varied personal prioritieswhether it's proximity to work, family, or access to amenitiesreducing the process to simply securing a unit, rather than finding a home that meets their specific needs. In light of these issues, one must wonder why HDB continue to implement this bundled ballot system. While the intention may be to streamline the application process and increase efficiency, it raises serious concerns about fairness and the ability of Singaporeans to secure homes that genuinely meet their needs. As the housing landscape evolves, it is essential for HDB to consider these implications and adapt its approach to better serve the diverse needs of its BTO applicants.",Housing,-0.9,0.95,0.9,0.993,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1g7yv3h/exposing_a_huge_flaw_in_the_current_bto_balloting/,Reddit,20/10/2024 13:36

t3_1gd1qae,Ask me anything lanesplitting,"Seen so many misunderstandings about lane splitting so i think its time ppl understand how it works. Issue with sg is that there r way too many cars compared to motorcycles so majority wont understand motorcycle issues. Yall can ask ur questions n me n other riders can answer it. I hope most ppl actually read this b4 i see another post on lane splitting. Ill try to explain some common points n yall can add/ask more.1) Lane splitting is illegal. No its not illegal, TP,LTA n other enforcement uses it so its ofc not illegal. Driving schools will tell u its a grey area so u do it at ur discretion (smthg like discretionary right turn)2) Ban lane splitting. If u think the current traffic isnt bad enough n u want even longer traffic sure go suggest to ur MP. Personally i feel like if someone can benefit from the space, why not. Just because i am stuck in jam doesnt mean everyone has to get stuck in jam. Thats just resentment.3) Lane splitting is not safe. Yes n No. The main issue with lane splitting is that it was never taught properly so for most riders its monkey see monkey do. This makes it very dangerous especially for newer riders(no experience) n older riders (no reflex). Once u have ridden for a certain no. Of years there will be rules u make (dont go too fast, only lane split between lane 1 n 2, keep a distance from the front, inch out b4 merging into lane splitting lane etc.)4) why is lane splitting safer? Motorcycles (smaller cc) have weaker braking power than cars so if there happens to be an accident/ebrake (common in sg), they cant avoid it. Why not go at a safe distance? Well if u drive in sg, a safe distance equals to impatient ppl cutting u off which makes it more dangerous. Also being able to see whats in front makes it much safer. Imagine driving in between 2 trucks vs driving between 2 cars.5) why do most riders lane split recklessly? Well like i said this is because it wasnt taught properly n maybe they r influenced by out JB riders which do it regularly. Malaysia has a higher presence of motorcycles which makes their drivers more careful hence they can be more reckless.6) Why do riders cut queue? Because they lane split to the front, it doesnt make sense to stay in the lane splitting lane when static as they r in the blindspot of the vehicles. They also put other riders at the back in danger as not all vehicles will move off straight. Usually most riders dont play phone n motorcycles have better pickup than cars so most will zoom off after green causing not much invonvenience. From my experience, i usually will cross the junction b4 the first car starts moving.Extra: Lane splitting is also dangerous due to drivers mentality in sg. Most dont signal n check blindspot when changing lanes. They also do the swerve lane change instead of gradual lane change. Another issue is lane sharing, drivers can give more space to make lane splitting more smoother (right lane stay more to the right n left lane stay more to the left) but most dont.In summary it can be safe/graceful if drivers n riders understand each other but in sg when everyone is selfish/entitled otr this issue will most likely stay till the future.",Transport,-0.6,0.8,0.6,-0.4808,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1gd1qae/ask_me_anything_lanesplitting/,Reddit,27/10/2024 3:06

What do you guys think are the general gaps in our healthcare insurance coverage? And would it make economic sense (because increased coverage means more expensive policies for everyone...usually) to plug these gaps? Do insurance agents and CEOs here, for example, earn too much proportionate to their effort and social benefits they provide? I'll start by saying that I think we should have limited coverage for psychiatric medication. We should also look at insurance covering things like sleep apnea machines. Both these things can help when your life isn't threatened but will help your general health in the long-term, leading to less claims in the future. Also, what do you think about having centralized drug stores?

t3_1hgr3qh,My view on the whole NRIC saga,"**The Evolution of NRIC Secrecy in Singapore**The recent controversy surrounding the new NRIC regulation has sparked intense debate. As I reflect on the developments, I realize that the perception of NRIC secrecy has undergone significant changes over the years.**Background: The Shifting Landscape of NRIC Secrecy**Growing up in the 90s, I recall that NRIC numbers were not as heavily guarded as they are today. As a class/ CCA representative, I had access to a list of my classmates' unmasked NRIC numbers to take attendance. However, even then, there is a perception on the privacy of NRIC. I recall my grandparents and parents always cautioned me against sharing my NRIC number, citing the risk of loan sharks.**The PDPA and the Masking of NRIC**With the introduction of the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) and the subsequent masking of NRIC numbers around 2019, the government emphasized the importance of protecting personal data. This move reinforced the notion that NRIC numbers are sensitive information to the general public.**Observations and Concerns**Despite the government's efforts to protect NRIC numbers, several observations raise concerns about the effectiveness of these measures:1. *Widespread distribution of NRIC numbers:* Prior to the PDPA and masking of NRIC numbers, these numbers were freely distributed, making it likely that they can still be found on older documents.2. *Formula of NRIC numbers:* The structure of NRIC numbers includes 'S' for those born before 2000 and 'T' for those born on or after 2000. The first two digits indicate the birth year (for the majority), and the next five digits represent the time of registration. This, coupled with the fact that the alphabet in NRIC numbers follows a fixed formula, makes it relatively easy to approximate a person's NRIC number, especially when combined with the last three digits and the alphabet.3. *NRIC numbers used for authentication:* Currently they are widely used as authentication details for government agencies and banks.4. *Public perception of NRIC secrecy:* The majority of Singaporeans view their NRIC numbers as secret and private information, often using them as passwords or for other private purposes.**The Dissonance Between Perception and Reality**These observations highlight a clear dissonance between the public's perception of NRIC secrecy and the reality of its vulnerability. This disconnect creates a false sense of comfort, which may lead to increased data theft.**Complications Arising from the New Regulation**The government's decision to move away from masking NRIC numbers raises several complications:1. *New authentication details:* The number one concern for everyone will be: what will the new authentication details be? Should the entire authentication process be revamped? The truth is, most authentication details (e.g., date of birth, address, mother's maiden name, etc.) are not exactly private information, but they are not public either. Using a sufficient number of data points should create a certain comfort level to take specific actions. These thresholds should definitely be set by the government with clear guidelines.2. *Balancing transparency and security :* While NRIC numbers may not be entirely private, making them publicly available may not be necessary or beneficial. In this regard, I am unable to understand the enhanced trust and transparency mentioned by the Government.**Conclusion**In conclusion, while reducing reliance on NRIC numbers as private information may be a positive step, it is essential to address the deeply ingrained perception of NRIC secrecy in the population. The government must clearly communicate the rationale and implications of the new regulation, ensuring a smooth transition and alleviating public concerns.**Side Notes**1. *Government communication :* The government's communication on this issue has been piecemeal and incoherent, leaving many wondering about the details particularly the intention of this new move.2. *Inter-agency coordination:* The lack of coordination between government agencies, as evident in the ACRA incident, highlights the need for improved communication and alignment.",Legal,-0.9,0.95,0.9,0.9963,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1hgr3qh/my_view_on_the_whole_nric_saga/,Reddit,18/12/2024 2:03

t3_1hhim3r,"Govt agencies have to comply with ""comparable, if not higher, standards of data protection compared to the PDPA"": MCI in 2019","Source: [ this old article interesting. There were questions raised back in 2019 on why government agencies should be exempt from the PDPA. At that time, Iswaran (then Minister for Communication and Information) said that govt agencies, unlike private orgs, are expected to adopt a whole-of-govt approach in delivering public services and this is very different from the private sector.But he also said that govt agencies need to comply with comparable, if not stricter, data protection standards.""Mr Iswaran noted that public sector agencies have to comply with Government Instruction Manuals and the Public Sector (Governance) Act (PSGA).Collectively, these provide comparable, if not higher, standards of data protection compared to the PDPA, he said, adding that similar investigations and enforcement actions are taken against data security breaches.""**So was ACRA's disclosure of full NRIC numbers in compliance with the govt's own data protection standards? If not, will investigation and enforcement actions be taken?**For private sector orgs, data breach incidents have to be notified to the PDPC and affected individuals, with remedial actions taken, in line with the timelines set out by the PDPC. See [ we expect to see some similar accountability on ACRA's part?

I think it is high time for ACRA to come forward and explain just how many people were affected, how they decided on whose NRIC numbers to disclose (was it only directors and shareholders or were others included too), why they decided it was necessary to publish this database, how they ended up running ahead of future policy intent, whether they can track who accessed the NRIC numbers or could have scraped the NRIC data they made available, and what remedial actions they are now going to take.

t3_1ho0vvl,Need advice on contesting Non-Accidental Injury assessment by doctors,"Dear Reddit,I am a Singaporean parent of 2 children and am desperate for some help or advice.My younger child (1 year old) fell down and injured her right arm. When we went to the hospital, the doctor classified it as a non-accidental injury (NAI), filed a police report against me and my spouse. We are feeling so shocked and frustrated because the hospitals treated us like child abusers without listening to our explanations and refused to discharge us until we signed documents to acknowledge that we caused a non-accidental injury. Because we were so tired, we just signed those documents to go home to sleep, and now we are regretting it.The injury was definitely not caused by us, and we think that it was instead caused by other doctors. I wanted to share our (long) story here to see if anyone has any medical or non-medical advice, perspectives or experiences to share.The background is that my family (me, my spouse, older child, younger child) went for holiday. On the flight, my younger child fell from the airplane seat. We didnt think much about it until 2 hrs later, when we realised that her arm was limp and she could not use it. We called for on-board medical assistance, and thankfully a pediatrician was on board. The pediatrician assessed the arm and the preliminary assessment was a dislocated elbow. She performed a maneuver to put the elbow back into place but it did not seem successful. So the pediatrician suggested we go to a hospital immediately upon landing.The airline was kind and arranged for an emergency ambulance to pick us up from the airplane and go straight to the hospital. At the hospital, an x-ray was taken and the doctor said that there was no fracture so it should be a dislocated or pulled elbow and performed a maneuver to put the elbow back into place. After the maneuver, the doctors took another x-ray to check that the elbow was fixed, and put her arm in a cast. We continued our holiday for 7 days, growing more and more worried as my child did not regain the usage of her hand.After flying back to Singapore, we immediately went to a hospital A&E to seek a second opinion and assess whether the injury was wrongly diagnosed in the foreign country. The A&E doctor took an x-ray and performed a closed reduction maneuver three times. However this was not successful, so it was referred to Orthopaedics. After waiting for a long while, the Orthopaedic doctor came by and asked many questions about how the injury came about. We had to take time to explain the whole background above while my child was still crying, and so we asked the doctor for his diagnosis and for treatment to be administered quickly as my child was in pain. The Orthopaedic doctor said that it could be a serious injury and that surgery under GA was needed. We were very surprised and initially did not want to agree to GA because our child is only one year old and there were risks. This doctor explained that this is the only way to fix the arm and if surgery is not done as soon as possible, there is risk of permanent deformation of the arm. As parents, when you hear an explanation like that, of course we agreed to the surgery.After the surgery, the doctors said that the operation went well and my child was warded for observation. While warded, we kept asking for details of the injury and a timeline for discharge but no one could give us a clear answer. Two days after the surgery, we received a call from the police saying that a police report had been made against us for non-accidental injury of our child and they needed to investigate because our account was inconsistent with the injury. I felt that this was ridiculous because the doctors had not even explained what injury my child had. After multiple requests for the medical report, the doctors finally told us that the injury was a right distal humerus physeal separation fracture.The doctors explained that it is impossible for such an injury to happen from a fall, as it would require such force if we were to swing our child from the arms. We explained that we definitely did not do such actions, and to us, it seemed more likely that the multiple doctors (on board the plane, the doctor in the foreign country, the A&E doctor) would have caused the fracture. The doctors dismissed our explanations, and insisted that they cannot discharge us until the investigations were complete.To make things worse, they required one parent to be with the child at all times, but refused to allow my older child into the ward. Hence, our family lived apart for five days which was the longest we had ever been separated. On the fifth day after the surgery, two documents (voluntary care agreement and safety plan) were presented to us stating that we as parents could have caused the non-accidental injury. The doctors said that we can be discharged if we sign the two documents, so of course we agreed to go home to see our kids, unpack from our overseas trip and rest properly in a bed.I used to believe that if youve done nothing wrong, youve got nothing to fear. However, after this incident, I realised that even in Singapore, if youve done nothing wrong, you do have something to fear. After going home and resting, we regretted signing those documents. We love our children so much and would never hurt them, but now we admitted guilt of injuring our child in a non-accidental manner. The doctors can still accuse you and confine you in a hospital ward until you sign a confession.Is it there any way for us to contest the doctors assessment that it was a non-accidental injury in Singapore? Does any medically-trained people know whether a right distal humerus physeal separation fracture is impossible to be an accident?

I found out that if you used SMRTs website to check out last train timings from their stations, it will say that it would depart at times like 1:30, past 2:00 and even as late as 3:00 am. Note that is is not marked as train service extensions (like on eves of holidays and events like F1) but rather regularly scheduled last trains every day. To my knowledge, most last trains depart from around 11:30pm till around 12:40-12:50am past midnight. Sure enough, after cross checking with the SGTrains website, the SGTrains Website had more realistic last train timings following the 11:30pm-12:50am window for last trains. So what happened here is either 1) SMRT are running later trains without anyone knowing or, more than likely, 2) SMRT has put out blatantly false and misleading information on last train timings. SMRT website is the light mode ones and the SGTrains website is the dark mode ones with examples from Botanic Gardens, Bras Basah, Chinese Gardens, Farrer Road and Woodlands South stations respectively. This error seems to impact most if not all stations listed on the SMRT website and not just these few stations only.",Transport,-0.8,0.9,0.8,0.1566,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1htjqfj,Reddit,4/1/2025 17:42
t3_1i81fgd,Why are the prosperity cults and mega churches allowed in SIngapore?,"Edit 2 : Mods have locked the thread. So I am going to summerise from the comments that made the most sense to my question here for easy future reference. ""They operate under the guise of legitimate religious practices. When their questionable activities are challenged, they often deflect criticism by framing it as an attack on religion itself.Given the sensitivity surrounding religious beliefs, this tactic effectively shields them from scrutiny. As long as they remain within certain boundaries, religion can become a convenient cover for financial gain."" - BubbleMikeTea""(for breach of trust) In the case of religious leaders it would be like telling the followers that they need to give money to improve church facilities but using the money to buy a house for themselves.If a leader were to very directly say that money is to be given to him to buy a nice house so that it reflects how well the church is doing, and people are gullible enough to do that, theres no crime."" - Available\_Ad9766""I think the root cause of this problem is not lack of law banning them but that so many people are vulnerable and susceptible to cults and marketing tactics, ripe for the picking. For scammers too.Modern society can be so isolating even in adulthood, and theres not a lot of education on mental health and self-awareness in raising our children. There are so many parents who dismiss their own emotions and their childrens. So when some cult salesperson give validation, they enjoy the sense of belonging."" -Fearless\_Carrot\_7351""Theres already a law thats why those involved went to jail, no? You can introduce laws but that doesnt prevent crime from happening. The government has laws against theft, yet people still commit theft"" - kaptainkrispyskin""Because of the size of the congregation, they become vote banks for the ruling party. Unfortunately it is not a crime to fool the gullible when it comes to faith. Whether he parts with his wealth or sells his HDB flat to finance the pastors wifes record sales is inconsequential. The best one can do it make sure your family does not into this trap."" - MolassesBulky""As long as humanity has the fear of the unknown like death there will always be religion and superstition believers.So just Live and let live. What you need to watch out for is if the ""values"" from religion creep into our constitution or laws. It's always a touchy subject since many of our ministers are christians that follow american evangelicalism."" - Bor3d-Panda\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ As my title suggest, I am wondering why are these type of churches allowed in SG.

t3_1i8nukf,"After moving to the UK, I realised that the Singapore passport isn't that great for mobility for the average person and the passport ranking doesn't mean much for most of us","Don't get me wrong, for a country of our size and population MFA is doing a fantastic job and we punch well above our weight. I have personally benefitted from the visa free access for some countries where my colleagues/non Singaporean friends had to jump through so many hoops to get through immigration.For the average person, however, a Singapore citizenship and passport does not actually offer that much tangible benefit in terms of day to day mobility and opportunities. A citizen of a larger country like the US, China, Australia, hell even our neighbour Malaysia has opportunity to move, study, work and live in different cities and towns but within the same country. For us we can only use it for travel or short business trips, which majority of Singaporeans don't utilise anyway.The average Johorean can move to KL for work if he/she wants a more fast paced life, and conversely KL back to Johor if he/she wants to relax a bit. A HK citizen can move to the greater bay area for more space and cheaper housing, and conversely back to HK if he/she wants to ""chiong"" and accelerate up the career. A citizen of EU can choose to work in one of the 27 countries if they so choose and pick and choose which culture/economy suits them. As with the US with its 50 states or India with its 28 provinces. For most of us in Singapore, however, we have no such option. Most of us born, study, live, work and die in the same place. We can't choose to work in the city then retire in the hometown, we can't choose to move between towns or cities and when we apply for jobs the same way others can because the only place we can tick yes to working rights is limited to employers on one island Singapore.Tough luck if one does not fit the Singaporean mould. If you have limited education or are single/lgbt then the life that lies ahead is essentially being stuck with one's parents until the government is gracious enough to grant access to a 2 room flat at the age of 35. And even tougher luck if one has crappy family, that means being traumatised way into one's adulthood since there is no rent control or suburbs and subdistricts to move to the way those in other countries can.I realised this when speaking to my international colleagues in my company and realising that most of them has had far more freedom of mobility than us despite holding less ""prestigious"" passports. The amount of barriers I had to jump through to get out of Singapore was really another level.

Lets say its $50 dollar per month, school canteen vendors are being pressed to put the price of serving rice+meat+veg+fruit for $2.00 to $2.50 and its at least $3-4 dollar lower than market. They justified it that because rental is Low. If we treat that $3-4 off as a way of rental, one stall sell hundreds plates per day, it will be totalled to $300 per day.

t3_1iizpp4,Leong Mun Wai rebukes accusations of racism by Shanmugam on his Facebook page,"There He Goes Again Yesterday in Parliament, I had asked a PQ to clarify whether the Government is reviewing the CMIO model in view of what Minister Edwin Tong has said at a recent IPS Conference that the model should be constantly reviewed to reflect Singapores increasingly complex multicultural landscape. I thought this was a reasonable question. But I was caught unawares when Minister Shanmugam suddenly dredged up two old issues and used them to accuse me of racial discrimination. These old issues are already well-documented in the Hansard. I acknowledge that when I raised the CECA issue in Parliament in 2021, there will be some people who will think that there is a racial undertone to it. This is unfortunate, but I have clarified many times that CECA was only raised as a potential economic issue. The debate was necessary because we believe the employment data provided by the Government is insufficient to form a full picture of the employment situation facing Singaporeans. The second issue was about a previous Facebook comment on HDB flats which was unrelated to this issue. I wish to reiterate what I said in the House yesterday, which is that PSP supports the Ethnic Integration Policy. But PSP also notes that the EIP may have caused economic disadvantages to minority communities which need to be addressed. I was speaking to advance the concerns of minorities, and genuinely seeking to represent their interests as a Parliamentarian and fellow Singaporean. I hope that Ministers will not be quick to label Singaporeans as racist when we want to clarify a socio-economic issue even if it touches upon race. (This principle is particularly important because we have just passed the Maintenance of Racial Harmony Bill on Tuesday). I have brought up many such sensitive issues, such as the sentences given to the PRC citizens involved in the $3 billion money laundering case. I am even more disappointed because it is Minister Shanmugam, who had spent the same six years with me in Raffles Institution, who has been making such allegations against me. Although we were never close friends in school, through our many common friends in our cohort, he should have known me better. After I graduated from RI, I have lived almost continuously for two decades overseas and have cultivated friendships with many schoolmates, co-workers and even customers. These friendships have helped me to develop a deep appreciation of multiracialism and multiculturalism and above all democracy and rule of law. I will always stand for these values and never against them!

t3_1ijq3kk,Why do all the private psychiatrist clinics in singapore not have fixed prices???,"It seems deliberate to me, so that when ur in consultation they can hassle their way to charging you more. They usually say things like $300 and above but they dont clarify the ""above"" part. When i ask them they always cant give a straight answer on the cap, said it depends on severity of the condition. I asked lets say very severe what is the maximum amount? Do you have a rubrics or some template to see how much you charge?? After getting angry they suddenly can bring the price down to $200. Also ive seen a psychiatrist that basically drags the conversation to 2 hours talking about needless stuff like his pet dog or something then charged me for the extra hour. He wrote a deliberately long memo that probably did not need to be that long and then charged way more. It seems all these things are quite subjective and the psychiatrist can basically say that the charges are warrented because the condition needs alot of writing, but how do we even confirm that? Different doctors tell me completely different things, when i say i might come to their clinics again suddenly they play nice and charge me less. Psychology is so subjective that 2 doctors can basically say 2 completely different things about a patient and be right so they usually pick the option that makes them able to charge you more.

t3_1ikflsi,Bikes and ebikes in Singapore,"Earlier today, I drove into an HDB car park. As the barrier went up and I drove forward, someone on an ebike raced through on my left, to also get through. Because of the road, he had to go as quick as he could to get straight in front of my car, as there was no space for him to be alongside me. I had no idea he was there at all until he suddenly appeared in front of me.I had to slow immediately (obviously I wasn't going at any kind of speed as I had stopped at the barrier) and beeped my horn. He reacted angrily, pointing at his eyes as if it was my fault that I hadn't seen him! I'll be honest, I was annoyed and for a couple of seconds considered going alongside him and winding my window down - but I realised there was no chance of a reasonable conversation so I just let him go off.Now had I hit him, it would have been his fault (and my camera would have shown this) but more importantly he would have been the one injured. I'd have had a scratch on my car but I would be completely unhurt. So I guess I'm writing this post to remind cyclists and electric bike riders that a driver in a car has much less awareness of you than you might think. I see cyclists at night on the road, wearing black, no helmet, with no lights on their bike - drivers CANNOT see you until the last moment, and that's not because they're not paying attention. Some car drivers are selfish, impatient, make dangerous manoeuvres - completely correct to say that. But cyclists are so much more exposed and likely to be hurt.

t3_1ikipfy,Tan Cheng Bock criticises Shanmugam for affecting public perception on PSP,"Multi-racialism, National issues and Mature politicsSome days ago, Minister Shanmugam leveled several well publicized accusations against my party comrade Leong Mun Wai. As the Ministers words affect the publics perception on PSP, I thought I should reiterate what PSP stands for. 1) PSP stands for multi-racialism. Singaporeans from all races form our membership, CEC leadership and GRC candidate slate. Our Nee Soon GRC candidates in GE 2020 is a good example. We readily fielded Caucasian, Chinese, Malay and Indian candidates, and will continue to do so. We are a party where all races have a voice.2) PSP stands for national issues. We did not shy away from questioning the Government on sensitive topics like CECA and CMIO. On the surface, these subjects have racial elements. But they also affect the well-being and livelihood of every Singaporean. As such, we will continue to be fearless when speaking up in Parliament on national issues.3) Finally the PSP stands for mature politics. I hope the Minister will be slow to label Mun Wai or the PSP as racist just because of some isolated incident or statements. Isolated lapses affect all parties and we should careful not to go overboard with our comments especially when they concern the highly flammable issue of race. For instance, when a minority MP from the Ministers GRC vacated her seat mid-term without replacement, would it be fair to say that the PAP cares little for minority representation? One may be tempted to infer so but mature politics will suggest surely not. The same can be said about making unfair racist inferences based on the statements in this case.Lets do better. For multi racialism, for national issues and for mature politics. Because we do it For Country, and For People.Source: Tan Cheng Bocks Facebook",Politics,-0.6,0.75,0.6,0.9721,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1ikipfy/tan_cheng_bock_criticises_shanmugam_for_affecting/,Reddit,8/2/2025 8:25
