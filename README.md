# Just Yap!

## About
Singaporeans frequently voice complaints on social media, but these platforms are cluttered with irrelevant content, making it hard to distill actionable insights. 

Just Yap! addresses this gap by collecting real-time complaints from social media, then using AI and machine learning to filter, categorise and analyse them. It visualises key insights to help authorities better understand public concerns. Additionally, Just Yap! generates AI-suggested polls, enabling government agencies to engage citizens on trending issues, fostering responsive and data-driven policymaking.

Currently, our real-time data collection pipeline collects complaints from the r/Singapore subreddit. In the future, we look forward to extending it to other sources like Facebook.
